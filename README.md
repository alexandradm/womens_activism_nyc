# WomensActivism.NYC

WomensActivism.NYC is a five-year celebration of the Women's Suffrage Centennial.

From now until the national celebration of the 19th Amendment in 2020, we will be highlighting unsung New York activists of the past and present.

By learning the stories of these courageous women we hope to inspire New Yorkers's to become more active  in the causes that are meaningful to them.
