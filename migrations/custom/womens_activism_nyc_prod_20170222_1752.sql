953	Simone de	Beauvoir	1908	1986	http://www.biography.com/people/simone-de-beauvoir-9269063	\N	Simone de Beauvoir was born in Paris, France, in 1908. When she was 21, De Beauvoir met Jean-Paul Sartre, forming a partnership and romance that would shape both of their lives and philosophical beliefs. De Beauvoir published countless works of fiction and nonfiction during her lengthy career—often with existentialist themes—including 1949’s The Second Sex, which is considered a pioneering work of the modern feminism movement. De Beauvoir also lent her voice to various political causes and traveled the world extensively. She died in Paris in 1986 and was buried with Sartre.	2016-08-26 13:24:43.657098	\N	f	t	1	https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/BOOKS/Pix/pictures/2014/1/9/1389261893620/Simone-de-Beauvoir-016.jpg	\N
3	Amal	Abbas			wisemuslimwomen.org	3	Amal Abbas is the only female editor-in-chief in the nation of Sudan and acts in the capacity for the Khartoum-based independent daily Al Raj al Akher. In response to her reporting about misappropriation of funds, Abbas was sent to prison and fined $6,000, but was later released.\n\nIn 2001, Abbas won the International Women’s Media Foundation Courage in Journalism Award.\n\nAbbas directs her reporting primarily towards the fiscal behavior of Sudanese officials. In addition to Abbas’s imprisonment, Al Raj al Akher has faced suspension frequently by the government’s National Press Council.\n\nA Khartoum court jailed Abbas, and Ibrahim Hassan, a reporter for the paper, for three months for failing to pay fines in a libel suit. The pair had been found guilty of libeling Khartoum governor Majzoub Khalifa in a 2000 article, accusing him of corruption and nepotism. They were ordered to pay fines of 15 million pounds (US$5,900) apiece and Al Rai al Akher was also hit with a 1 billion pound fine (US$390,000), allegedly the largest fine ever imposed in a libel suit in Sudan. 	2016-08-25 17:40:10.127714	\N	f	t	1	http://media.gettyimages.com/photos/sudanese-journalist-amal-abbas-and-editor-in-chief-of-altayyar-osman-picture-id148464280	
4	Anisa	Abd el Fattah	1955		wisemuslimwomen.org	4	Anisa Abd el Fattah was born into a “family of Baptist ministers.” When her parents divorced, she began attending Catholic school.  She credits this experience with fostering in her “an interest in religion and particularly how religions impact people and the world that we live in and share.” She converted to Islam in the 1980s and began her career in Muslim community work in 1989 as the business director for the Jamaat Ibad el Rahman private school in Jersey City, New Jersey.  Prior to joining the school, she had worked as an independent local community activist, working with immigrant Muslim women and families in the New York metro area. It was while employed at the Jammat Ibad el Rahman that Anisa founded the National Association of Muslim Women which became the National Association of Muslim American Women (NAMAW) in 1994.  Anisa says of the organization:\n"We began as a self-help Muslim woman’s organization that was mostly Muslim women raising money to help other, mostly single and divorced Muslim women to pay rent, purchase food, and keep their lights on. That was in 1989. Now we are a UN-accredited NGO, that is also a political action committee. Our goal is to bring the political voices of Muslim American women into the mainstream political dialogue in the U.S., where we can use our unique perspectives and experiences to make a positive difference in the lives of others."\nLater, Anisa was invited by the International Right to Life Organization to join its delegation to the Beijing Conference as an observer but the Chinese government repeatedly refused her application for a visa.  Unable to attend the conference, she continued efforts to lobby for the pro-life position in the US and was quoted by many leading newspapers in the US on the topic.  She also appeared on NPR, the USA Radio Charlie Butts Show, and CNN International.\nFollowing the Beijing conference, she established the International Association for Muslim Women and Children, an accredited NGO with the UN Habitat Conference, and also the UN Division on the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinians. Most recently, through the International Association for Muslim Women and Children, Anisa along with Ethiopian human and women’s rights activists established the Al-Falah project, an HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment project in Ethiopia.  Anisa has been credited with developing the blueprint for what later became the American Muslim Council and served for nearly 10 years as an unofficial advisor. She was also a founding member of the Council on American Islamic Relations (CAIR).  In 1996, she founded Muslim Women for America and initiated a national Muslim voter’s registration campaign.  That same year she wrote, Islam and the Veiling of Women and co-authored The Agent: Truth Behind the Anti-Muslim Campaign in America.\nIn 1998, she served as director of community outreach for a pro-life senatorial candidate in northern Virginia. She has also served as the editor-in-chief of Al-Jathiya, the newsletter for the National Association of Muslim American Women.  \n	2016-08-25 17:40:10.13894	\N	f	t	1	http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3475/3911208410_48485b5bcf_m.jpg

9	Abigail	Adams	1744	1818	www.womenofthehall.org	9	Wife of one president and mother of another, Abigail Adams (was more than a family helpmate. Insightful, witty, and intensely concerned with politics, she shared and shaped her husband John’s political thought and career. Because of his service to the nation in war and diplomacy, they spent more than half their married life apart, but they communicated closely. In early 1776 she was caring for their four young children alone, but she wrote him to urge daring and boldness.\nIn her famous “Remember the Ladies” letter, Abigail Adams proposed that women should claim their share of liberty. She objected specifically to the legal codes under which married women could not own property. But she was ahead of her time; later generations of women would have to struggle to change such laws.\n“I desire you would remember the ladies and be more generous and favorable to them that your ancestors.  Do not put such unlimited power into the hands of the husbands. Remember, all men would be tyrants if they could.  If particular care and attention is not paid to the ladies, we are determined to foment a rebellion, and will not hold ourselves bounds by any laws in which we have no voice or representation.”\n	2016-08-25 17:40:10.260522	\N	f	t	1	https://www.womenofthehall.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/abigail-adams-205x268.jpg	
11	Jane	Addams	1860	1953	www.womenofthehall.org	11	Jane Addams was one of the first generation of American women to attend college. After graduation, unmarried, she struggled to find a career and a purpose. Finally in London she discovered Toynbee Hall and the cause to which she would devote her life: the settlement house, a special facility established to help the poor. In 1889 she and a college friend moved into the slums of Chicago. They called their dilapidated old mansion Hull House.\nSoon a nationwide settlement house movement sprang up. Jane Addams spoke and wrote widely about settlement work. Her vivid stories made the plight of the poor heartbreakingly immediate. She prodded America to respond to the terrible ills of industrial development: child labor, infant mortality, urban crowding and unsanitary conditions, unsafe workplaces, juvenile delinquency, unemployment, and poverty wages.\nHer pacifism during World War I caused Jane Addams’s reputation to suffer. In the hysterical intolerance of the “Red Scare” she was branded “the most dangerous woman in America” by self-appointed superpatriots. But her accomplishments could not be denied. Calmer times brought renewed recognition, capped by the Nobel Peace Prize in 1931.\n\n	2016-08-25 17:40:10.292086	\N	f	t	1	https://www.womenofthehall.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/jane-addams-205x278.jpg

28	Louisa May	Alcott	1832	1888	www.womenofthehall.org	28	A prolific author of books for American girls, Louisa May Alcott is best remembered for Little Women, one of the 270 published works by the Pennsylvania-born woman. This endearing novel captured forever the period’s ideals and values of middle class domestic life. The book has appeared continuously in print since its first serial publication in 1868-70.\nThe popular novel drew largely upon her personal experiences. The second of four daughters, Alcott began her writing to support her perpetually impoverished family. Her strong and loving mother was a significant force in her life. “I think she is a very brave, good woman,” Alcott wrote of her mother. “And my dream is to have a lovely, quiet home for her, with no debts or troubles to burden her.”\nBeginning with the publication of the poem Sunlight under a pseudonym in 1851, Alcott poured forth a variety of thrillers, poems, potboilers and an occasional juvenile tale. In 1867, she became editor of a children’s magazine, Merry’s Museum. At the urging of her publisher there, Alcott undertook the writing of Little Women. The novel, like her other works, was formed largely in her mind before she took pen to paper. The entire novel was written in two six-weeks periods.\nIn 1879, Alcott was the first woman to register in Concord when Massachusetts gave women school, tax and bond suffrage. Eventually she persuaded her publisher to publish Harriett Hanson Robinson’s Massachusetts in the Woman Suffrage Movement in 1881. In her final novel, Jo’s Boys (1886), Alcott made arguments for women’s rights and other reforms. She said, “I can remember when anti-slavery was in just the same state that suffrage is now, and take more pride in the very small help we Alcotts could give than in all the books I ever wrote…”\n\n	2016-08-25 17:40:10.573163	\N	f	t	1	https://www.womenofthehall.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/louisa-may-alcott-150x150.jpg

31	Linda G. 	Alvarado	1951		www.womenofthehall.org	31	Linda G. Alvarado has changed the “male only” image of construction contractors across the United States and opened doors for women to enter construction and non-traditional fields of endeavor. Alvarado is founder and sole owner of Alvarado Construction, a commercial general contractor, construction management and design/build firm in Denver, Colorado; President of Palo Alto Inc., and co-owner of the Colorado Rockies Baseball Club.\nBorn in Albuquerque, New Mexico, Alvarado grew up poor in a family with six children. Working her way through college she earned money as a laborer for a landscape firm, later taking courses in estimating and computerized scheduling and began as a contract administrator on a construction project. Undaunted by construction site harassment she experienced being a woman, in 1976 she started her own company. There were no programs to include women or minority-owned businesses and banks viewed this “woman contractor” as a high risk. Her parents mortgaged their small home and lent her $2,500 to start one of the most successful construction firms in the country; starting with concrete sidewalks to bus-stop shelters, schools, stadiums, convention centers, aquariums, hotels, and high-rise buildings.\nIn 1992 Alvarado made history as the first Latino (male or female) owner of a Major League Baseball team, the Colorado Rockies. This also marked the first time a woman was in a bid for ownership of a major league franchise. Alvarado and her husband, Robert, founded Palo Alto Inc. which operates 150 franchise restaurants.\nAt the young age of 27 Alvarado was invited to join the board of United Bank and today serves on the board of five public companies. She sets high standards as a successful business owner and her accomplishments have created opportunity for women. Alvarado has given numerous speeches at business conferences and at schools, motivating youth to excel and achieve their dreams.\nAlvarado has been honored as one of the “100 Most Influential Hispanics in America” by Hispanic Business Magazine. She is a recipient of the Horatio Alger Award, the Sara Lee Front Runner Award and was voted American Latino T.V. Network’s “Most Inspiring American Latino”.\n\n	2016-08-25 17:40:10.630623	\N	f	t	1	https://www.womenofthehall.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/linda-g-alvarado-205x224.jpg	
33	Dorothy H. 	Andersen	1901	1963	https://www.womenofthehall.org/	33	Dorothy H. Andersen pediatrician and pathologist, was the first scientist to identify the disease, cystic fibrosis. Her research and discovery in 1938 of this, at that time, fatal disease led the way to modern day advances in the treatment and management of the illness.\nA graduate of Mount Holyoke College, 1922, and the Johns Hopkins University Medical School, 1926, Andersen overcame the prevailing discrimination against women in medicine and spent most of her professional career as a pathologist at Babies Hospital, Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center in New York.\nShe continued her research on cystic fibrosis during the 1940s and was able to develop a simple, definitive diagnostic test for this genetic disorder. The test made it possible for pediatricians to immediately begin appropriate treatment, thereby greatly extending the lifespan of the cystic fibrosis patient. What had been a fatal disease in infancy became a treatable disorder, leading to the survival of young people with cystic fibrosis into adulthood.\nDuring World War II, Dr. Andersen developed a training program for surgeons pioneering in open-heart surgery. She was also recognized for her path breaking research work in nutrition.\nThroughout her career she was deeply committed to professional equality and refused to pattern her life according to conventional ideas of what was suitable for women.\n\n	2016-08-25 17:40:10.666559	\N	f	t	1	https://www.womenofthehall.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/dorothy-h-andersen-205x261.jpg

Marian Anderson sang joyfully in the church choir whose members raised the funds for her to attend music school. “We don’t take colored,” they told her coldly at the music school where she inquired. But she built a career anyway, scraping up money for lessons, and riding the black-only “Jim Crow” railroad cars to sing before black audiences and becoming the first African-American singer to perform as a member of the Metropolitan Opera in New York City.\nLike many black artists in the days of segregation, she had to go to Europe to gain recognition. The show business promoter Sol Hurok heard her in Paris and decided to bring her back to this country, ignoring those who told him, “You won’t be able to give her away.” Her famous concert at the Lincoln Memorial on Easter Sunday, 1939, demonstrated that her great talent could shatter the color line.\nThe first African-American to perform at the White House, Marian Anderson’s career helped to make music one of the first fields in which Black Americans’ achievements were given fair and full recognition. Her many honors and recognitions included the Presidential Medal of Freedom and a Grammy Award for Lifetime Achievement.\n\n	2016-08-25 17:40:10.679657	\N	f	t	1	https://www.womenofthehall.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/marian-anderson-205x259.jpg

39	Nina	Ansary	1967		www.womensenews.org	39	Dr. Nina Ansary: Los Angeles' Unearther of Unexpected Consequences\n\nBorn in Tehran, Nina Ansary was only 12 when she left Iran in 1979 at the cusp of the Islamic Revolution, and has not returned since.\n\nGrowing up in New York City, Ansary received her B.A. in sociology from Barnard College and her M.A. in Middle Eastern studies from Columbia University. In 2013, Ansary finished her Ph.D. in history from Columbia University.\n\nAnsary is the author of the upcoming book "The Jewels of Allah," based on her doctoral thesis about the women's movement in Iran. Inspired by her scholarly journey, Ansary seeks to shatter the stereotypical assumptions and the often misunderstood story of women in Iran today.\n\n"In writing this book, my intention is to pay homage to the myriad of accomplished women in Iran, who, despite the patriarchy of the current regime, continue to shine their bright light," Ansary said.\n\nShe added, "When I first started to conduct my research, I was baffled by the fact that women were one of the biggest supporters of Ayatollah Khomeini, and in fact a contributing factor to the collapse of the Pahlavi Monarchy. As an Iranian woman, this piece of information was not only counterintuitive but difficult to reconcile, given that the Pahlavi regime was solely responsible for emancipating the Iranian woman."\n\nWhile doing her doctoral research, Ansary discovered a startling truth: In the three and a half decades since the Islamic Revolution, the number of women in higher education has increased from just over 35 percent at the cusp of the 1979 revolution to 80 percent now.\n\n"Today, despite all obstacles and the current regime's best laid plans to redirect women into the private domain, the female population in Iran is distinguished by an unprecedented surge in female literacy and a flourishing feminist movement against the boundaries of a traditional religious prescription," Ansary said.\n\nShe said the education surge happened because when Khomeini came into power, he segregated society and mandated the veil. Such measures initially proved to be a liberating medium for the traditional segment of the female population. The schools were now segregated and many traditional families who could not relate to the westernized trend set in motion by the Pahlavi Monarchy, felt it was safe to send their daughters to school in a newly chaste atmosphere.\n\n"These are some of the unanticipated consequences of measures undertaken by the Islamic regime, which ironically ended up empowering women. I refer to them as fortuitous blunders by Khomeini where women are concerned."\n\nThe current regime, Ansary added, has routinely attempted to silence the women's movement. "Therefore, a crucial ingredient is for the international community to engage in bringing attention to the plight of women in Iran who continue to be debilitated by the irrational premise of patriarchal laws."\n\n--By Jan Paschal\n	2016-08-25 17:40:10.745082	\N	f	t	1	https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71JbciT4VqL._UX250_.jpg

41	Susan B.	Anthony	1820	1906	https://www.womenofthehall.org/	41	Susan B. Anthony taught school in New Rochelle and Canajoharie, New York, and discovered that male teachers were paid several times her salary. She devoted her first reform efforts to anti-slavery and to temperance, the campaign to curb alcohol. But when she rose to speak in a temperance convention, she was told, “The sisters were not invited here to speak!” Anthony promptly enlisted in the cause of women’s rights.\nIn a lifelong partnership with Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Anthony’s organizational skill and selfless dedication built the women’s rights movement. The ballot, she became increasingly to believe, was the necessary foundation for all other advances. When she and Stanton published a newspaper, they called it The Revolution. Its motto was “Men their rights and nothing more; women their rights and nothing less.” In order to press a test case of her belief that women, as citizens, could not be denied the ballot, Anthony voted. She was tried, convicted and fined for voting illegally.\nFor over thirty years she traveled the country almost ceaselessly working for women’s rights. In 1906, her health failing, Anthony addressed her last women’s suffrage convention. Although she sensed that the cause would not be won in her lifetime, she looked out across the assembled women and told them, “Failure is impossible.”\n\n	2016-08-25 17:40:10.778636	\N	f	t	1	https://www.womenofthehall.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/susan-b-anthony-205x256.jpg	
42	Susan Brownell	Anthony	1820	1906	http://www.centralparkwherearethewomen.org/	42	"A champion of temperance, abolition and African American rights, the rights of labor, and equal pay for equal work, Susan B. Anthony devoted her life to organizing and leading the woman suffrage movement.  Born on February 15, 1820, in Adams, Massachusetts, Anthony was raised in a Quaker family that encouraged women’s education. From an early age, Anthony made her life's work one of justice and sought to establish equality in the larger world. \nAt age 26 Anthony began working as a teacher. Over the next 15 years, Anthony would not only teach, but advocate for equal pay between male and female teachers and equal access to education regardless of race or gender. She continued her call for equal pay, and in 1870 Anthony helped form and was elected president of the Workingwomen’s Central Association. This organization evaluated working conditions and created educational opportunities for working women. Anthony was also active in the anti-slavery movement, working as an agent for the American Anti-Slavery Society, often making speeches for the cause. Anthony and fellow activist Elizabeth Cady Stanton organized a Women’s National Loyal League in support of the Thirteenth Amendment in 1863. \n          \nAnthony became involved in the temperance movement in the late 1840s. In 1848, she made her first public speech at a Daughters of Temperance supper. The following year, Anthony was elected president of the Rochester branch of the organization. When the Sons of Temperance in Albany refused to let Anthony speak at their 1853 state convention, she called her own meeting. Along with Stanton, Anthony founded the Women’s State Temperance Society. The organization created a petition that called for a law that would limit the sale of liquor. However, the New York State Legislature would not accept the petition since the majority of the signatures were from women or children. Anthony realized that women needed the right to vote so their signatures would be accepted on petitions. \nA skilled political strategist, Anthony was a leader of the woman suffrage movement and, after meeting Stanton in 1851, their partnership dominated the movement for over 50 years. Anthony was a founding member of the American Equal Rights Association which pushed for a constitutional amendment for suffrage.  She and Stanton opposed the 14th and 15th amendments for not enfranchising women. Anthony published The Revolution, a radical paper that often called for equality between men and women. The paper’s masthead was "Men their rights, and nothing more; women, their rights, and nothing less.” \nWhen the suffrage movement split in 1869 Anthony helped found the National Woman Suffrage Association, which continued lobbying for a constitutional amendment. During the 1870s Anthony campaigned for suffrage in the western part of the United States. Anthony was then arrested in 1872 for voting, was tried and convicted. She led a woman’s protest at the 1876 Centennial delivering a "Declaration of Rights" written by Stanton and Matilda Gage. Anthony, Stanton, Gage, and Ida Harper also wrote and published the History of Woman Suffrage.\nIn the late 1880s, Anthony laid the groundwork for the unification of the National Woman Suffrage Association and the American Woman Suffrage Association. Anthony then served as the vice president of the unified National American Woman Suffrage Association from 1890 to 1892, and as president from 1892 to 1900.  Anthony gathered signatures on suffrage petitions at the state and national levels, undertook arduous state tours to organize suffrage campaigns in the states and nationally.  She also worked to ensure the support of organized labor groups. Called “The Napoleon of the woman’s rights movement,” Anthony lobbied yearly before Congress.  She was active in international suffrage circles, and personally raised money to ensure admission of women to the University of Rochester in 1900.  Anthony remained active in the woman's movement until her death on March 13, 1906, 14 years before women received the right to vote."

She became the first African American in the Texas legislature in over 80 years, and was the first female representing Texas in the House not following her husband. She spoke with razor-sharp logic and clarity on the national stage, demonstrating how superior an African-American, and a woman, could be to a nation that had denied the advancement of both for so long.

44	Virginia	Apgar	1909	1974	https://www.womenofthehall.org/	44	Virginia Apgar brilliant physician and humanitarian, is best known for her development of the Apgar Score (1952), a system to determine whether a newborn infant needs special attention to stay alive. In most births at the time, attention was focused on mothers, not the newborns, which resulted in many infant deaths. This simple test, performed in the very first minutes of a baby’s life, measures an infant’s pulse, skin color, activity and respiration very quickly, enabling medical staff to intervene if help is needed. This simple but brilliantly conceived examination has saved countless newborn lives.\nApgar, one of the few women admitted to Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons in the 1930s, trained first in surgery, but shifted her work to anesthesiology, a new field that offered the opportunity to do groundbreaking work. She was soon named director of anesthesiology at Columbia, the first woman to head a department at the University. In 1949, after she built a major academic department in the discipline, she was named the first full professor of anesthesiology — the first woman to hold a full professorship in any discipline at Columbia University.\nApgar’s career shifted again in 1959 when she became a senior executive with the National Foundation-March of Dimes, and spent her time working to generate public support and funds for research on birth defects. She was a spectacular fundraiser and educator of the public, and greatly increased both visibility and attention paid to the problems of birth defects.\nIn 1973, she became the first woman to receive the Gold Medal for Distinguished Achievement in Medicine from the College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University.

She was hired in 1940 and traveled widely raising money and organizing local branches. In the late 1950s she helped create SCLC to fight racism; in her role as executive director (as opposed to King’s primary spokesperson role).\nAs students – black and white – became involved in the movement, Baker supported the idea of a student-run organization, and encouraged young people to found SNCC. SNCC organized many successful voter registration drives and other activities. Baker was also an adviser to the creation of the Mississippi Democratic Freedom Party (MDFP), created to help overturn the all-white Democratic Party delegation to the party conventions.\n\n	2016-08-25 17:40:11.136862	\N	f	t	1	https://www.womenofthehall.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/ella-baker-205x253.jpg

62	Lucille	Ball	1911	1989	https://www.womenofthehall.org/	62	One of the most beloved comediennes of all times, Lucille Desiree Ball, left an impact on the business and entertainment industries that endures still today. Speaking of her profession, Ball once said, “You cannot teach someone comedy, either they have it or they don’t.”\nBorn in Jamestown, New York, Lucille Desiree Ball left her hometown at the age of fifteen to study drama in New York City and began her early entertainment career with stints as a model and Goldwyn Girl. Making her film debut in 1933, Ball became known as the “Queen of the B’s” for her numerous roles in B-movies. She appeared in more than 75 films even before starting the show that would ultimately change the face of entertainment.\nIn 1951, Ball and her husband, Desi Arnaz, launched a comedy television series, I Love Lucy, based on their own lives. The show pioneered technical aspects of a comedy show, using three cameras, a set, and a live audience. It was also the first time a visibly pregnant woman was seen on television. The show became the launching pad for the endearing comic genius of Ball.\nProving that her talents extended beyond the realm of comedy, the entrepreneur became the first female studio head in Hollywood. As president of Desilu Productions, she broke the glass ceiling for women executives in the film and television industry and her shows live on in syndication.\nBall went on to garner thirteen Emmy nominations and four Emmy Awards for her work. In 1986, she received a Kennedy Center Honor for her contributions to the world of entertainment. In 1989, she was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom.\nMany of today’s comediennes and actresses still count Ball as a mentor and influence and her legacy of laughter and business acumen continues to inspire.\n\n	2016-08-25 17:40:11.202607	\N	f	t	1	https://www.womenofthehall.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/lucille-ball-205x258.jpg

105	Dana	Bolger			www.womensenews.org	105	Dana Bolger: D.C.'s Campus Rape Survivor Turned Title IX Activist\n\n\n\nOrganizers such as Amherst College alum Dana Bolger are bringing new life and activism to the enforcement of the historic women's rights law, called Title IX. \n\nBolger, co-founder of Know Your IX, said her organization aims "to give students that basic legal literacy around the rights they have and the schools' responsibilities to fill them," by informing college students that the federal law requires academic institutions that receive federal funds to not discriminate on the basis of gender. \n\n"If you don't know you have them [these rights] you can't protect them and insist that your school honor them," Bolger said.\n\nBolger, along with other survivors of sexual violence, founded Know Your IX after discovering firsthand the impact of not knowing her rights. After her report of sexual violence and stalking by a fellow student to a college dean, Bolger temporarily left campus as the dean recommended. Later, she learned she was entitled to stay on campus and continue her education. \n\n"Once I learned I had that right I was able to stand up for myself and march into meetings with administrators and demand my place on campus," Bolger said.\n\nNow a full-time job for Bolger, Know Your IX has a two-pronged strategy. First, the organization educates students about their rights to an education free from violence. The website, written largely by survivors and with the guidance of attorneys, covers basic information on Title IX and provides resources ranging from starting a campaign on individual campuses to how to find a lawyer. It also publishes "Know Your Rights" advertisements in campus newspapers and online.\n\nThe second strategy, ED ACT NOW, lobbies the federal Department of Education for more energetic enforcement of the law in cases of rape, dating violence, stalking and harassment more broadly. Last year, the organization's impact was felt when the department stepped up its enforcement, including issuing public findings of non-compliance against several colleges and universities. \n\nThis year, Bolger and her co-organizers are broadening the organization's focus to campaign for economic justice for survivors. \n\n"Often we don't think about the financial impact of violence, especially on campus rape survivors… that could be anything from tuition refunds for a survivor who is left no choice but to drop out of school and take time off, medical costs or the costs for STD treatment, or counseling costs," Bolger said.\n\nIn addition, Know Your IX seeks to expand media coverage and the law's enforcement to the full range of higher education institutions, including at technical and community colleges, and in the midwest and southern U.S. \n\n"The current system puts a significant burden on survivors to take the initiative to file complaints, which is not a particularly easy process," Bolger said. "Basically we are asking for transparency and enforcement." \n\n--By Meagan Lee Butler \n	2016-08-25 17:40:11.937319	\N	f	t	1	http://urge.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/dana-bolger.jpg	
192	Angela 	Davis			http://feministstudies.ucsc.edu/faculty/singleton.php?singleton=true&cruz_id=aydavis	192	Angela Y. Davis is known internationally for her ongoing work to combat all forms of oppression in the U.S. and abroad. Over the years she has been active as a student, teacher, writer, scholar, and activist/organizer. She is a living witness to the historical struggles of the contemporary era.\n\nProfessor Davis's political activism began when she was a youngster in Birmingham, Alabama, and continued through her high school years in New York. But it was not until 1969 that she came to national attention after being removed from her teaching position in the Philosophy Department at UCLA as a result of her social activism and her membership in the Communist Party, USA. In 1970 she was placed on the FBI's Ten Most Wanted List on false charges, and was the subject of an intense police search that drove her underground and culminated in one of the most famous trials in recent U.S. history. During her sixteen-month incarceration, a massive international "Free Angela Davis" campaign was organized, leading to her acquittal in 1972.\n\nProfessor Davis's long-standing commitment to prisoners' rights dates back to her involvement in the campaign to free the Soledad Brothers, which led to her own arrest and imprisonment. Today she remains an advocate of prison abolition and has developed a powerful critique of racism in the criminal justice system. She is a founding member of Critical Resistance, a national organization dedicated to the dismantling of the prison industrial complex. Internationally, she is affiliated with Sisters Inside, an abolitionist organization based in Queensland, Australia that works in solidarity with women in prison.\n\nLike many educators, Professor Davis is especially concerned with the general tendency to devote more resources and attention to the prison system than to educational institutions. Having helped to popularize the notion of a “prison industrial complex,” she now urges her audiences to think seriously about the future possibility of a world without prisons and to help forge a 21st century abolitionist movement.\n\nDuring the last twenty-five years, Professor Davis has lectured in all of the fifty United States, as well as in Africa, Europe, the Caribbean, and the former Soviet Union. Her articles and essays have appeared in numerous journals and anthologies, and she is the author of nine books, including Angela Davis: An Autobiography; Women, Race, and Class; Blues Legacies and Black Feminism: Gertrude "Ma" Rainey, Bessie Smith, and Billie Holiday; The Angela Y. Davis Reader; Are Prisons Obsolete?; a new edition of Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass; and The Meaning of Freedom.\n\nFormer California Governor Ronald Reagan once vowed that Angela Davis would never again teach in the University of California system. Today she is Distinguished Professor Emerita in the History of Consciousness and Feminist Studies Departments at the University of California, Santa Cruz. In 1994, she received the distinguished honor of an appointment to the University of California Presidential Chair in African American and Feminist Studies.	2016-08-25 17:40:13.416792	\N	f	t	1	http://f.tqn.com/y/womenshistory/1/W/S/r/3/Angela-Davis-52604010-x1.jpg	\N
69	Eleanor K. 	Baum	1940		https://www.womenofthehall.org/	69	In 1984, Dr. Eleanor K. Baum became the first female engineer to be named dean of an engineering college in the United States, breaking many professional gender barriers along the way. Dr. Baum’s career as an engineer began at City College of New York where she was the only female in the 1959 engineering class. “I felt very conspicuous,” she said, “but I was stubborn enough to stick it out.” Later she earned both her masters degree and Ph.D. in electrical engineering from Polytechnic Institute of New York. During this time she discovered what became a life-long passion, a love for teaching. She began her teaching career as an assistant professor at Pratt Institute in Brooklyn. Her subsequent appointment to chairperson of the electrical engineering department was an historic achievement. In 1987, Dr. Baum moved her career across town to Cooper Union. As Dean of the Albert Nerken School of Engineering at Cooper Union in Manhattan and Executive Director of the Cooper Union Research Foundation, she spent over twenty years vigorously promoting engineering as a profession, particularly for women. Recognizing the stereotypical image of the white male engineer, Dr. Baum worked to dispel such thinking by actively encouraging young women and minorities to pursue careers within the profession. When she became dean at Cooper Union, 5% of the student body was female. Under Dr. Baum’s leadership, that number increased to 40%. Dr. Baum is committed to recognizing the importance of positive engineering and female role models for high school and college students. She belongs to several professional organizations that share those convictions. In 1995, she was elected president of the American Society for Engineering Education, another first for a woman. She is an active member of the Society of Women Engineers and has served as national president of the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology. In 1996, Dr. Baum was inducted into the Women in Technology International Hall of Fame. A frequent writer and speaker on educational and engineering issues, she is the author of many professional articles; a director on several business, professional, and college advisory boards; holder of more than 20 awards and citations; and also, five honorary doctorates from major colleges and universities including Notre Dame University and Union College. 	2016-08-25 17:40:11.327989	\N	f	t	1	https://www.womenofthehall.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/eleanor-k-baum-205x309.jpg	
70	Jennifer	Baumgardner	1970		http://www.jenniferbaumgardner.net/	70	Jennifer Baumgardner is a writer, activist, filmmaker, and lecturer whose work explores abortion, sex, bisexuality, rape, single parenthood, and women’s power. Since 2013, she has been the Executive Director/Publisher at The Feminist Press at the City University of New York (CUNY), a second wave feminist institution founded by Florence Howe in 1970.\nBaumgardner grew up in Fargo, North Dakota and attended Lawrence University in Appleton, Wisconsin, graduating in 1992. While at Lawrence, she helped organize an anti-war “Guerrilla Theater,” lead a feminist group on campus, and co-founded an alternative newspaper called The Other that focused on intersectional issues of liberation. She moved to New York City after graduation and in 1993 began working as an unpaid intern for Ms. magazine. By 1997 she had become the youngest editor at Ms. Through public appearances, books, articles, and film, Baumgardner promoted a positive, matter-of-fact, and accessible approach to speaking publicly about controversial issues—which she referred to as "common-but-silenced"[7]—such as abortion, rape, and sexuality. Called "dependably attentive to the gray areas around divisive issues,[8]" this "simple" approach also elicits criticism of her work from feminists and other who find her "off-puttingly naive".[9] In her 2009 collection of essays entitled F 'em: Goo Goo, Gaga, and Some Thoughts on Balls, Baumgardner described the Third Wave she helped to define and represent:\n\n"The Third Wave grew out of an enormous cultural shift. By the late 1980s, a cohort of women and men who’d been raised with the gains, theories, flaws, and backlash of the feminist movement were beginning to come of age. Whether or not these individual men and women were raised by self-described feminists—or called themselves feminists—they were living feminist lives: Females were playing sports and running marathons, taking charge of their sex lives, being educated in greater numbers than men, running for office, and working outside the home. For those who were consciously feminist, the splits of the 1980s formed the architecture of their theories. Kimberlé Crenshaw’s description of “intersectionality” drew on the work of the Combahee River Collective and advanced the idea that gender might be just one of many entry points for feminism.\n\nThe Third Wave rejected the idea of a shared political priority list or even a set of issues one must espouse to be feminist. It inherited critiques of sexist dominant culture (having grown up in a feminist-influenced civilization) and embraced and created pop culture that supported women, from Queen Latifah to bell hooks to Riot Grrrl. Girlie feminists created magazines and fashion statements (and complicated the idea of what a feminist might look like). Sex positivity undermined the notion that porn and sex work are inherently demeaning, and revealed a glimpse of the range of potential sexual expression.\n\nTrans feminism, both the idea (much of it from Judith Butler) that gender is performed and a growing belief that gender exists on a spectrum, complicated the legitimacy of women-only spaces as sites of unadulterated liberation. Reclaiming words like 'slut' and 'girl' was as urgent as protests had been. Transparency about whether a feminist had worked out her body image issues, felt upset by an abortion, or believed that any hair could be unwanted replaced strong, black-and-white statements. Activists spoke from personal places, not to overshare, but to tell the truth about their lives and what had happened to them.\n\nThird Wave feminism was portable—you didn’t have to go to a meeting to be feminist; you could bring feminism into any room you entered. Where the Second Wave radicals believed in mass movement and the liberal feminists believed in creating women’s institutions to influence men’s, a Third Waver might say, “Every time I move, I make a women’s movement,”1 indicating a feminism that is more individually driven. Institutions like NOW and Ms. magazine attenuated, in part because Third Wave feminists didn’t need any members to be feminist."  	2016-08-25 17:40:11.343586	\N	f	t	1	https://scontent-lga3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xaf1/v/t1.0-9/11892002_464665430407431_8196624873528786445_n.jpg?oh=a90d60a97d0a885d7d58734c200152f4&oe=578931DD

75	Alva	Belmont	1853	1933		75	Alva Belmont, "an ardent feminist and agitator for women’s equality, Belmont was devoted to women’s equality, and donated thousands of dollars to the NWP to advance its work for national and international women’s rights. Born in 1853 on an Alabama cotton plantation, Alva Belmont claimed she learned of women’s inequality as a child when she was told that girls were not supposed to run or climb trees. At 22, she married William Kissam Vanderbilt, the second son of William H. Vanderbilt, owner of the Grand Central Railroad. The couple had three children, Consuelo, William II, and Harold Vanderbilt. In 1895, they divorced and Belmont received a substantial monetary settlement and Marble House in Newport, Rhode Island. One year later, she married Oliver H. P. Belmont. Alva dedicated her life to women’s causes after Oliver’s death in 1908, including support of the garment workers strike, where she pushed for a boycott of nonunion dress manufacturers. In 1909, she founded the Political Equality Association in New York, working under the umbrella of the National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA). In 1909-1910, Alva coordinated and funded the move of the NAWSA headquarters from Ohio to New York City.\nIn 1909, Belmont witnessed a Pankhurst rally at the Royal Albert Hall in London, and it soon became clear to the NAWSA that she was more militant than conservative. In 1914, Belmont broke from the NAWSA and turned her focus to Alice Paul and the Congressional Union for Woman Suffrage, whose strategy was more in line with Belmont’s... From 1914 to 1920, she served on the executive board of organization. In August 1914, she hosted the Congressional Union conference at Marble House in Newport, Rhode Island and opened a summer headquarters for the organization. Belmont also helped shape the new CU/NWP policy of holding the party in power, the Democratic Party, responsible for not adopting a federal suffrage amendment. Additionally, Belmont was also the one to suggest the need for “a women’s party” and pushed the CU to rebrand itself as the National Woman’s Party in 1916.\nAfter passage of the 19th Amendment, Belmont became the president of the NWP, a position she held until her death in 1933. At the same time, Belmont’s views on women’s equality became more extreme. At an NWP meeting in 1920, she urged the organization to “obtain…full equality with men” and to “make (women) a power in the life of the state.” She argued for the NWP to become a third American political party to form a wedge between the Democrats and Republicans, and for the election of a female president. Vowing to vote only if—and when—a female was nominated for President of the United States, Alva never utilized the right she so strongly fought for. Although Alice Paul privately agreed with Belmont’s views, she tactfully persuaded Belmont to support the Equal Rights Amendment instead believing this to be the best way for the NWP to make a change to women’s status.\nAlva Belmont’s financial contributions helped sustain the NWP, and all policy matters required her approval... In 1921, she gave the NWP money to purchase the new headquarters in the Old Brick Capitol, but the NWP was forced to sell in 1929 so the Supreme Court could be built; at that point, they moved across the street to 144 Constitution Avenue. During the 1920’s Belmont moved to France where she settled permanently and her focus shifted to international women’s equality issues. In 1926, she formed the International Feminist Committee, which later became the International Advisory Committee of the NWP.\nAs a philanthropic activist, Alva Belmont “blazed the trail for the rest to walk in.” She died in 1933 in France where she lived her later years. Her funeral at St. Thomas Episcopal Church in New York City featured all female pallbearers and was attended by approximately 1,500 people. Having left strict instructions regarding her wishes for the service, Belmont’s coffin was draped with one of the picket banners with the slogan “Failure is Impossible."From the Sewall-Belmont House and Museum\n	2016-08-25 17:40:11.422158	\N	f	t	1	http://www.nyu.edu/projects/mediamosaic/thepriceoffashion/img/portanovaj/7.-Mrs.-O.H.P.-Belmont_sm.jpg	
77	Ruth Fulton	Benedict	1887	1948	https://www.womenofthehall.org/	77	Ruth Fulton Benedict was a pioneering anthropologist who became America’s leading specialist in the field, best known for her “patterns of culture” theory. Her book by that name revolutionized anthropological study, igniting the work of the culture and personality movement within anthropology. She strengthened the bonds among the branches of social science: anthropology, sociology and psychology, and deepened public understanding of the impact of culture on human behavior and personality.\nShe received her bachelor’s degree from Vassar College and her PhD from Columbia University, where she was a student of Franz Boas and then was his assistant. She became the mentor of Margaret Mead. Ruth Benedict did her fieldwork in the American west among the Serrano, Zuni, Cochiti, Pima, and Mescalero Apache. Benedict’s academic career, 1923-1948, was at Columbia University, where she was appointed full professor in the Faculty of Political Science in 1948, the first woman to achieve that status. She acted as Chair of the Anthropology Department from 1936-1939, edited the Journal of American Folklore from 1925-1940, and worked for the United States” war effort in the Office of War Information, 1943-1945.\nRegarded by many as America’s first woman anthropologist, author of six books: including the path-breaking Patterns of Culture (1934), deemed one of the major works of intellectual history of the 20th century, “It marked a turning point in American culture between what we think of today as 19th and 20th century ideas.” Benedict’s concept of cultural configuration, the idea that a culture is not a random collection of traits, but a unique patterning or organization of these traits, has been a major contribution to the world’s understanding of cultural diversity. Among her other works are: Tales of the Cochiti Indians (1931), Zuni Mythology (1935), and The Chrysanthemum and the Sword (1946), Ruth Benedict also wrote and published poetry under the name Anne Singleton. Benedict was an active anti-racism voice during the 1940s. Her book Race: Science and Politics (1940), refuted then current theories of racial superiority. The book was used for a teaching unit on race and racism, and a public affairs pamphlet co-authored with Gene Weltfish, that was in turn used as the foundation for a children’s book, cartoon-movie and comic book.\nRuth Benedict met the challenges of her time: barriers and undercompensation of women in academe, obstacles to women doing fieldwork, racial and cultural superiority assumptions in the social sciences, with superior work, incisive observation, methodological analysis, and wide-ranging intellectual brilliance. She met personal challenges in her married life and in being a hearing impaired researcher, accomplishing her fieldwork with assistance from interpreters and extraordinary dedication and initiative. Benedict believed “The purpose of anthropology is to make the world safe for human differences.”\n\n	2016-08-25 17:40:11.461109	\N	f	t	1	https://www.womenofthehall.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/ruth-fulton-benedict.jpg	
100	Amelia Jenks 	Bloomer	1818	1894		100	Amelia Bloomer worked for women's rights and was part of the suffrage and temperance movements. Bloomer is know for advocating for a dress reform that consisted of a short dress with a pair of pants underneath. This style was worn by women before, but Bloomer spread its popularity and the outfit was named "Bloomers" after her. Bloomer advocated for this style because women's fashion in the 1850s consisted of tight-fitting corsets, layers of petticoats that could weigh over 10 pounds and floor length dresses, which led to a lack of freedom for women. Bloomer also wrote about social issues for her husband's newspaper, the Whig. In 1848 Bloomer attended the first Women's Rights Convention in Seneca Falls.	2016-08-25 17:40:11.843087	\N	f	t	1	http://wyatt.elasticbeanstalk.com/mep/SA/images/sagbloo.jpg

Growing up in Belize (with its very small Indian population), Sayu stated that she always felt “different but in a way that was very integrated.” Sayu left Belize to pursue higher education in the U.S. It was here in ‪NYC‬ – home to one of the top 5 most diverse counties in the country – where Sayu felt simultaneously “reassured” by the multitude of cultures present and dismayed by the inequities she observed. After gaining a graduate degree at Columbia University, she began working with a NYC nonprofit in Asian-American communities.\nAs Sayu tackled Asian-American concerns, she noted that many of the leaders and policymakers in these communities did not resemble their constituents. She also saw a number of South Asian youth who were struggling and needed more assistance. As a result, in 1996, she created South Asian Youth Action! – a nonprofit aimed at fostering “a strong sense of belonging in youth and provid[ing] them with tools to thrive academically, professionally and personally.”\nThe success of that program and Sayu’s continued involvement in immigrant issues soon led her to becoming NYC’s 1st Commissioner of Immigrant Affairs. In this role, “she worked with immigrant advocates to pass the City’s [landmark] legislation to protect the rights of domestic workers and increase access to translation and interpretation services.”\nIn 2011, Sayu founded the New American Leaders Project (NALP), a national non-partisan program which prepares 1st and 2nd generation immigrants to become civic leaders. Sayu stated, “When immigrants run and win, they also bring with them key experiences and perspectives that inform policy once in office.”	2016-08-25 17:40:11.590206	\N	f	t	1	http://www.netrootsnation.org/wp-content/uploads/userphoto/1157.jpg

Many nineteeth-century physicians, including a few women, practiced without a degree, but Elizabeth Blackwell wished to attain full professional status. She was rejected by all the major medical schools in the nation because of her sex. Her application to Geneva Medical School (now Hobart & William Smith Colleges in Geneva, New York) was referred to the student body. They accepted with great hilarity in the belief that it was a spoof perpetrated by a rival school.\nWorking with quiet determination, she turned aside the hostility of the professors, students, and townspeople. She earned her medical degree in 1849. Blackwell completed her medical education in Europe, but faced additional difficulties in setting up her practice when she returned to New York. Barred from city hospitals, she founded her own infirmary. Eventually she founded a Women’s Medical College to train other women physicians.\nBlackwell’s educational standards were higher than the all-male medical schools.

110	Louise	Bourgeois	1911	2010	https://www.womenofthehall.org/	110	One of the world’s most preeminent artists, Louise Bourgeois’s career spanned over seven decades. Her varied and extensive body of work has been displayed in the collections of major museums worldwide.\nBorn in Paris, Louise’s appreciation of art began in childhood, when she helped her parents in their tapestry restoration workshop. Her interests shifted in her late teens and at the age of twenty-one, she earned a degree in philosophy from the Sorbonne. A year later, however, she returned to her true passion – art. That led to further education at the Ecole du Louvre, Ecole des Beaux-Arts, Atelier Bissiere and Academie de la Grande Chaumiere.\nIn 1938, after marrying Robert Goldwater, Bourgeois moved to New York City and later became an American citizen. Once in New York, she continued to immerse herself in art and enrolled in the Art Students League. Through her work with paint, sculpture and textiles, Louise explored sexuality and relationships in terms of the figurative versus the abstract, femininity versus masculinity and beauty versus revulsion. Her work often explored childhood trauma and hidden trauma that follows through life. She is noted for linking sexuality, fragility, and insecurity.\nThe 1940s saw Louise turn her attention to sculpture. It was this work that would ultimately lead to her worldwide recognition as a leader in the field of confessional art. In 1949, Bourgeois debuted a sculptural exhibit considered to be the first art installation, a groundbreaking way for artists to present their work.\nBourgeois’s acclaim grew throughout the 1970s, and in 1982, she became the first female artist to be given a retrospective at The Museum of Modern Art in New York. She is the only American of two women sculptors represented in the National Gallery of Art Sculpture Garden on the Mall in Washington, DC; there are fifteen men.\nShe received numerous awards for her work, including the National Medal of Arts (1997), La Biennale di Venezia’s Golden Lion (1998), the Japan Art Association’s Praemium Imperiale Award (1999) and the French Legion of Honor medal (2008).\n	2016-08-25 17:40:12.01028	\N	f	t	1	https://www.womenofthehall.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/louise-bourgeois-205x288.jpg

After her graduation, she became enthralled with the machine age, photographing the industrial plants in Cleveland, the Chrysler Building in New York City. She was one of the first photographers for Fortune magazine in 1929 and in 1935 she was one of the first photojournalists selected to work for Life magazine.\nHer photographs of a dam under construction in New Deal, Montana and the towns nearby were the cover and lead articles of the first issue of Life. She said of her work, “My life and my career was not an accident. It was thoroughly thought out.” Bourke-White remained with Life through the 1950s when illness curtailed her work.\n\n	2016-08-25 17:40:12.024804	\N	f	t	1	https://www.womenofthehall.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/margaret-bourkewhite-150x150.jpg

114	Lydia Moss	Bradley	1816	1908	https://www.womenofthehall.org/	114	Born in Indiana, Lydia Moss Bradley grew up on the frontier, educated in a log home before becoming a wealthy businesswoman, an entrepreneur and the founder of what eventually would become Bradley University.\n\nAs a pioneer in so many fields, Bradley experienced both success and tragedy. She and her husband, Tobias Bradley, had six children, but all succumbed to various frontier diseases. In 1896, after becoming a millionaire through her various business activities, Bradley founded Bradley Polytechnic Institute in memory of her children. Originally organized as a four-year academy, Bradley University became a four-year college in 1920 and has continued to grow and distinguish itself ever since. Bradley University is today a fully accredited institution that supports undergraduate and graduate education in engineering, business, teacher education, nursing, physical therapy and the liberal arts.\n\nInspired by this goal of creating an institute that taught boys and girls together and that combined practical and classical education, Bradley became a leader in land development and agriculture. She was the first female member of an American national bank board in the United States when she joined the Board of Directors of Peoria’s First National Bank. She gave the Society of St. Francis the use of a large estate for a hospital, which is now the OSF St. Francis Medical Center, one of the largest medical facilities in downstate Illinois. In 1884, she built the Bradley Home for Aged Women to care for widowed and childless women. She donated the land and pushed the city fathers of Peoria to establish a park system, the first in Illinois.\n\n	2016-08-25 17:40:12.068278	\N	f	t	1	https://www.womenofthehall.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/lydia-moss-bradley-205x229.jpg

Bradwell began her legal career with the 1868 establishment of the Chicago Legal News, which carried information about laws, ordinances and court opinions admissible as evidence in court. Bradwell, publisher and editor, also used its pages and power to advocate for women’s rights, speaking out for women’s suffrage, and removal of property ownership rights by women. She was permitted to run her business by special charter allowing a married woman to do so.\nIn 1869 Bradwell helped created Chicago’s first women’s suffrage convention, and passed the Bar. Despite an appeal to the state Supreme Court, she was refused admission because of her gender. Progress was made when the Illinois legislature opened most professions to women, and Bradwell was admitted to the United States Supreme Court and Illinois Supreme Court in 1892, retroactive to her initial application in 1869. 	2016-08-25 17:40:12.101823	\N	f	t	1	https://www.womenofthehall.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/myra-bradwell-205x284.jpg	
116	Mary	Breckinridge	1881	1965	https://www.womenofthehall.org/	116	Mary Breckinridge was the nation’s foremost pioneer in the development of American midwifery and the provision of care to the nation’s rural areas as founder of the Frontier Nursing Service.\nBreckinridge, descendant of a distinguished family that included a U.S. vice president and a Congressman and diplomat, lost her first husband and two children to early death. She turned to nursing as an outlet for her energies, committed to “raise the status of childhood everywhere,” as a memorial to her own lost children. She spent time as a public health nurse during World War I, and became convinced that the nurse-midwife concept could help children in rural America.\nAfter additional nursing studies and midwifery training, she went to rural Kentucky and began work in 1925. In 1928, her service was named the Frontier Nursing Service, and was for several years entirely underwritten by Breckinridge’s personal funds. Designed around a central hospital and one physician with many nursing outposts to compensate for the absence of reliable roads or transportation, the service featured nurses on horseback able to reach even the most remote areas in all kinds of weather. Within five years, FNS had reached more than 1,000 rural families in an area exceeding 700 square miles and staff members of FNS formed the organization that became the American Association of Nurse-Midwives. Breckinridge masterminded the fundraising and publicity necessary to keep the service growing. The Frontier School of Midwifery and Family Nursing, another part of FNS, trained hundreds of midwives.\nThe FNS hospital in Hyden, Kentucky is now named the Mary Breckinridge Hospital, and it operates today, with a new Women’s Health Care Center, still fulfilling the mission that Breckinridge created in the 1920s. On her deathbed Breckinridge commented, “The glorious thing about it is that it has worked!”\n\n	2016-08-25 17:40:12.131007	\N	f	t	1	https://www.womenofthehall.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/mary-breckinridge-205x283.jpg	
119	Nancy G.	Brinker	1946		https://www.womenofthehall.org/	119	Nancy Brinker  is regarded as the leader of the global breast cancer movement. In 1982, with a promise to her dying sister, Susan G. Komen, she founded Susan G. Komen Breast Cancer Foundation (now known as Susan G. Komen®). At that time breast cancer was not openly discussed, there were no 800- numbers, and few, if any, support groups. Treatment options and research funding streams were limited. In a few short years after its founding, the work of the foundation broke the silence around breast cancer and Susan G. Komen® is now the world’s largest grassroots network of breast cancer survivors and activists fighting to save lives, empower people, ensure quality care for all and energize science to find cures.\nHer creativity in awareness raising campaigns led to revolutionary programming. Since the first Susan G. Komen Race for the Cure® in 1983, the race has evolved into the world’s largest and most successful education and fundraising event for breast cancer, with annual events in over 150 cities throughout the world. Through her model, she became a pioneer in the concept of cause-related marketing, allowing millions to participate through businesses that share the commitment to eradicate the disease. The foundation’s advocacy work has increased legislation and greater government funding leading to major advances in breast cancer research.\nA breast cancer survivor herself, Ms. Brinker’s determination to create a world without breast cancer is matched by her passion to enlist every segment of society to participate in the battle. Her efforts have garnered her much recognition including the Presidential Medal of Freedom awarded by President Barack Obama, the Mary Woodard Lasker Award for Public Service, the Champions of Excellence Award from the Centers for Disease Control, Forbes Trailblazer Award, and the Anti-Defamation League Americanism Award, among many others.\nShe has also served in several significant government positions including U.S. Ambassador to the Republic of Hungary, U.S. Chief of Protocol, a lifetime member of the Council on Foreign Relations, and Goodwill Ambassador for Cancer Control for the United Nation’s World Health Organization. Through opportunities afforded her in these positions, she continues to put cancer control at the top of the world health agenda.\n\n	2016-08-25 17:40:12.170673	\N	f	t	1	https://www.womenofthehall.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Brinker-Nancy-205x268.png	
121	Gwendolyn	Brooks	1917	2000	https://www.womenofthehall.org/	121	“I am interested in telling my particular truth as I have seen it.” Gwendolyn Brooks has seen her truth on the south side of Chicago where her parents moved when she was less than one year old. An introverted, shy child, she grew up reading the Harvard classics and the Black poet Paul Lawrence Dunbar. And she grew up writing. Her first poem was published when she was 14.\nGraduating from Wilson Junior College during the Depression, she could only find work as a domestic worker and as secretary to a spiritual advisor. Later, she became publicity director of the youth organization of the NAACP in Chicago. She continued writing and by the end of the early 1940’s her poetry was appearing in Harpers, Poetry, and The Yale Review. In 1945, her first volume of poetry A Street in Bronzeville was published. “I wrote about what I saw and heard on the street,” she said of that book. In 1949, she published Annie Allen, a series of poems that traces the progress to womanhood of a Black girl. It was for this volume that she won the Pulitzer Prize in 1950.\nIn 1967, an established and respected poet, she attended a writer’s conference at Fisk University where, she says, she rediscovered her blackness. Her subsequent poetry broke new ground for her, reflecting the change that occurred at Fisk. The Mecca, a book-length poem about a mother searching for her lost child in a Chicago housing project, shows this new direction. This volume was nominated for the National Book Award for poetry. Her other work includes children’s books, an autobiography, and a collection of poetry about South Africa. Her work is collected in a single volume titled: BLACKS. She has been called a poet who has discovered the neglected miracles of everyday existence. For Brooks, it was all a matter of telling her truth.\n\n	2016-08-25 17:40:12.200698	\N	f	t	1	https://www.womenofthehall.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/gwendolyn-brooks-205x251.jpg

During her lifetime, her friends called her "Maggie", but after her death, a 1960 Broadway musical based on her life and its 1964 film adaptation were each entitled The Unsinkable Molly Brown.Margaret's fame as a well-known Titanic survivor helped her promote the issues she felt strongly about: the rights of workers and women, education and literacy for children, historic preservation, and commemoration of the bravery and chivalry displayed by the men aboard the Titanic. During World War I in France, she worked with the American Committee for Devastated France to rebuild areas behind the front line, and helped wounded French and American soldiers. She was awarded the French Légion d'Honneur for her good citizenship, activism, and philanthropy in America.

127	Tania	Bruguera	1968		http://www.art21.org/artists/tania-bruguera	127	Tania Bruguera was born in Havana, Cuba. Bruguera, a politically motivated performance artist, explores the relationship between art, activism, and social change in works that examine the social effects of political and economic power. By creating proposals and aesthetic models for others to use and adapt, she defines herself as an initiator rather than an author, and often collaborates with multiple institutions as well as many individuals so that the full realization of her artwork occurs when others adopt and perpetuate it. She expands the definition and range of performance art, sometimes performing solo but more often staging participatory events and interactions that build on her own observations, experiences, and interpretations of the politics of repression and control. Bruguera has explored both the promise and failings of the Cuban Revolution in performances that provoke viewers to consider the political realities masked by government propaganda and mass-media interpretation. Advancing the concept of arte útil (literally, useful art; art as a benefit and a tool), she proposes solutions to sociopolitical problems through the implementation of art, and has developed long-term projects that include a community center and a political party for immigrants, and a school for behavior art.\n\nTania Bruguera attended art schools in Havana, including the Instituto Superior de Arte (1987-92), and received an MFA from the School of the Art Institute of Chicago (2001). She received a Guggenheim Foundation fellowship (1998), and has been awarded residencies at Skowhegan (2002); Headlands Centers for the Arts (1998); Fundación Museo de Arte Contemporáneo de Maracay (1998); Art in General (1997); and ART/OMI (1995). Major exhibitions of her work have appeared at the Van Abbemuseum (2014); Queens Museum (2013); National Museum Wales (2012); Havana Biennial (2010, 2003, 2000); Neuberger Museum of Art (2010); Venice Biennale (2009, 2001); Tate Modern (2008); Moscow Biennial (2007); Kunsthalle Wien, Vienna (2006); Shanghai Biennial (2004); Istanbul Biennial (2003); Documenta (2002); San Francisco Art Institute (2002); SITE Santa Fe Biennial (1999) and the São Paulo Bienal (1996).

130	Pearl S.	Buck	1892	1973	https://www.womenofthehall.org/	130	Pearl Sydenstricker was the child of American missionaries. She grew up in China and was always “mentally bifocal”, as she put it. Becoming a writer at an early age, she married John Buck, an American agricultural expert in China, and bore a daughter. Her family was caught up in the turmoil of modern China, and in 1927 she narrowly escaped with her life from an angry mob, leaving behind an early manuscript.\nHer novel, The Good Earth (1931), rocketed her from obscurity to international fame. The Good Earth headed the best seller list for months, sold nearly two million copies, and was translated into thirty languages. It inspired a Broadway play and a Hollywood film, and was awarded the Pulitzer Prize. In 1938, having published several other novels, she won the Nobel Prize in literature.\nPearl Buck continued to be a remarkably productive writer. A born storyteller, she took plot and character ideas from two different cultures, and her writings shone with universal human appeal. Her over seventy books always sold well. She wrote a book about her father, her mother, and even, courageously, about her daughter’s mental retardation. Late in life she turned more to philanthropy, especially to the cause of East-West understanding.\n\n	2016-08-25 17:40:12.359986	\N	f	t	1	https://www.womenofthehall.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/pearl-s-buck-205x279.jpg

Bugbee covered the suffrage movement and in December 1912 walked with the suffragists as they made a cold, wet one-hundred-and-fifty-mile march to Albany, carrying a petition to the legislature to put suffrage on the agenda. As they walked, the reporters were subject to the same slurs and outcries as the petitioners; in fact, Bugbee later said, the reporters considered themselves soldiers in the war for the vote, as war correspondents later linked themselves to the doughboys they covered in Europe. At the end, she wrote, exultantly:\n\n"The march to Albany is now history. The suffrage army marched in triumph into the city this afternoon and drew up with a flourish before the State Capitol at precisely 4:30 o’clock. The faces of the little band were flushed with the exaltation of victory, and they gazed long and wistfully at the great stone building, which is the repository of all their hopes as well as the goal for which they have endured cold and storm and hunger and blistered feet for two long weeks. Then they turned with a satisfied sigh and marched down the hill to the hotel, where General Rosalie Jones disbanded her army." \n	2016-08-25 17:40:12.395609	\N	f	t	1	Photo file

133	Betty	Bumpers	1925		https://www.womenofthehall.org/	133	Betty Flanagan Bumpers, former First Lady of Arkansas, has dedicated her life to issues affecting children’s health, empowering women, and the cause of world peace. A former art teacher, Bumpers was educated at Iowa State, the University of Arkansas, and the Chicago Academy of Fine Arts.\nWhen she became First Lady of Arkansas, the state had one of the lowest immunization rates in the nation. Mrs. Bumpers spearheaded a statewide immunization program for childhood vaccinations, and the state achieved one of the highest immunization rates in the country. The “Every Child By “74” project model that brought together the Arkansas League for Nursing, the State Health Department, the Arkansas National Guard, the State Nurses Association, the State Medical Society, and the Cooperative Extension Service of the University of Arkansas, faith-based organizations, and other volunteers, was so successful it was used by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for immunization programs across America. It continued into the next decade.\nWhen Jimmy Carter became President, Mrs. Bumpers contacted him and explained the deficits in the country’s immunization program, and urged him to work to improve the situation. At that time, only 17 states in the country required immunizations by school age. Mrs. Bumpers” and Mrs. Carter’s advocacy led to the first federal initiative in comprehensive childhood immunization, launched in 1977. These efforts led to laws in every state requiring vaccinations before entry into school.\nIn 1991, responding to the 1989-1991 measles epidemic, Betty Bumpers and Rosalynn Carter founded Every Child by Two to ensure that all children in America are immunized on schedule by age two and that states develop immunization registries. Former Secretary of Health and Human Services Donna Shalala said, “from Arkansas to Washington, DC, to the far corners of the globe, Betty has been a guardian of children, protecting them from polio, from rubella and from many other invisible enemies.”\nIn 1982, Mrs. Bumpers, concerned about the growing nuclear arms race, formed Peace Links to “effect a mindshift in the way people think” about peace and nuclear war. For twenty years Peace Links, which encompassed over 200 gubernatorial and congressional women and global women leaders, worked to educate communities about a new concept of national security, the value of cultural diversity, non-violent conflict resolution, global cooperation, citizen diplomacy, violence prevention and peace building. Through the National Peace Foundation, she continues to draw the world together into a unified community dedicated to peace.\n\n	2016-08-25 17:40:12.411031	\N	f	t	1	https://www.womenofthehall.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/betty-bumpers-205x234.jpg	
134	Anne Charlotte	Bunch	1944		https://www.womenofthehall.org/	134	A pioneering strategist and organizer, Charlotte Bunch is one of the foremost advocates of international attention to women’s issues, and the inclusion of gender and sexual orientation on global human rights agenda.\nA 1966 Magna Cum Laude graduate of Duke University, Bunch became active on the national scene as a writer, lesbian activist and lecturer, particularly in movements for women’s liberation and women’s rights. She created and edited Quest: A Feminist  Journal (1974), one of the first and the leading journals to promote analysis and policy making to improve women’s status in society.\nExpanding her activities into the international arena, Bunch built an international network of women, united by common concerns, and prepared by education and training for effective action. Through her speeches and organizing at international conferences, she served as a critical catalyst for action on women’s issues. For example, her speech to Amnesty International in 1989 marked the beginning of that organization’s efforts to address gender-specific human rights issues. Her leadership was crucial to the adoption by the 1993 U.N. Conference on Human Rights, in Vienna, of strong support for women, and at the 1995 U.N. Conference on Human Rights, in Beijing, for supporting woman’s place in human rights advocacy.\nIn 1989, Bunch founded The Center for Women’s Global Leadership at Douglass College, Rutgers University, where she remains as Founding Director and Senior Scholar. Through the Center, she served as leader of national and international networking, advocacy and training, to advance women’s well-being around the world.\n\n	2016-08-25 17:40:12.428508	\N	f	t	1	https://www.womenofthehall.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/charlotte-anne-bunch.jpg	
135	Lucy	Burns	1879	1966		135	Lucy Burns was born in Brooklyn, New York in 1879. Burns worked with the National American Woman Suffrage Association as a leader of the Congressional Committee. Her first job assignment was to organize a national suffrage parade in Washington, D.C. on March 3, 1913. The organization of the parade was modeled on the elaborate suffrage pageants held in Britain and local marches organized in New York. Lucy was arrested six times and spent more time in jail than any other American suffragist in the U.S. \n\nI find Lucy Burns inspiring because she was willing to fight for the cause even if that meant she was going to be jailed. Even while she was detained she went on a hunger strike, was forced fed with a tube through her nose, and still kept on fighting. Her perseverance and her will to continue is why I find her to be so amazing!\n\n	2016-08-25 17:40:12.449821	\N	f	t	1		
136	Lucy	Burns	1879	1966		136	Lucy Burns, the lively Irish lass from Brooklyn, and Alice Paul, the shy Quaker girl from New Jersey, formed an unbeatable partnership that changed the dynamics of the Woman Suffrage struggle. Both were scholars studying abroad when they met while working with the Pankhursts in England and Scotland. Returning to America, they brought their own unique version of nonviolently militant tactics back with them and seized the offensive in the American Woman Suffrage campaign. Doris Stevens, in the classic book Jailed For Freedom, called Paul the "cool strategist" and Burns "the passionate rebel." Inez Haynes Irwin, in The Story of Alice Paul and the National Woman's Party, said "Alice Paul had a more acute sense of justice. Lucy Burns, a more bitter sense of injustice. Lucy Burns would become angry because the President or the people did not do this or that. Alice Paul never expected anything of them." \nFirst, in 1912, leading the Congressional Committee of the National American Woman Suffrage Association, then, in 1913, creating the Congressional Union for Woman Suffrage, and, finally in 1916, forming the National Woman's Party, Burns and Paul challenged both the government led by President Woodrow Wilson as well as the more conservative suffragists. Women were asked to put their own issues first. From 1917 - 1919, Burns, Paul, and members of the National Woman's Party picketed the White House and were attacked by mobs, arrested, and put in prison. They initiated hunger strikes and were subjected to beatings and the torture of forced feeding. It is a chapter of American history that few people know, but it is an absolutely vital part of how women won the vote.  The photo below of Lucy Burns in her jail cell was taken in 1917.  The 1920 photo of Alice Paul was taken when the battle for Woman Suffrage had been won.\n	2016-08-25 17:40:12.4652	\N	f	t	1	https://scontent-lga3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xfa1/v/t1.0-9/3899_535566703317303_1801330005697504425_n.jpg?oh=68e546b94b3f400add5176584867c9c8&oe=57861E89

Serving as its president from 1975 to 1982, Calderone and SIECUS fought to gain recognition of the idea that sexuality reflects the entire human character, not solely our gender-nature. Working to ensure that children receive a sound foundation in sex education at home and at school, Calderone has helped young people understand and appreciate their own sexuality. Her numerous books have taught thousands of confused and reluctant parents how to explain sex and sexuality to their children.\n\nCalderone’s work has been recognized through numerous awards including the Margaret Sanger Award from Planned Parenthood Federation of America, the Lifetime Achievement Award from the Schlesinger Library of Radcliffe/Harvard College, and the Award for Human Service from the Mental Health Association of New York.\n\nSummarizing Calderone’s contributions, People magazine wrote: “What Margaret Sanger did for birth control and Rachel Carson [did] for the environment, Calderone . . . has done for sex education. Her work, like theirs, has profoundly changed the quality of life in this century.” 	2016-08-25 17:40:12.506664	\N	f	t	1	https://www.womenofthehall.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/mary-steichen-calderone-205x289.jpg	
140	Annie Jump	Cannon	1863	1941	https://www.womenofthehall.org/	140	Astronomer Annie Jump Cannon perfected the universal system of stellar classification still in use today, and compiled the largest accumulation of astronomical information ever assembled by an individual – the Draper Catalog.\nCannon was an assistant at the Harvard Observatory beginning in 1896, and working with Williamina Fleming, she undertook a continuation of the project of recording, classifying and cataloging all stars down to the ninth magnitude. The resulting classification system by temperature was her concept, and was universally adopted. More than a quarter of a million stars were so classified, and published as The Draper Catalogue in nine volumes, from 1918 to 1924.\nCannon became curator of astronomical photographs of the Observatory in 1911 and professor of astronomy in 1938. She published the Draper Catalogue Extension in two volumes (1925 and 1949), with thousands more stars catalogued. These works were of enormous value to the science of astronomy, and forever secured Cannon’s place in scientific history. Cannon was a women’s suffrage advocate and a member of the National Women’s Party.\n	2016-08-25 17:40:12.519861	\N	f	t	1	https://www.womenofthehall.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/annie-jump-cannon.jpg	
141	Luisa	Capetillo	1879	1922		141	Luisa Capetillo was a  feminist and labor leader, born in the town of Arecibo, Puerto Rico. With her parents' encouragement, Capetillo read European literature and philosophy, studying the work of the Russian novelist Leo Tolstoy, the French anarchist and free-love advocate Madeleine Vernet, and the English philosopher John Stuart Mill. Capetillo embraced anarchism, but she valued women's participation in politics. In 1908 she attended a national meeting of the Free Federation of Workers where she advocated suffrage for all women, departing from elite suffragists, who recommended the vote for literate women only. Capetillo's conception of women's freedom went far beyond political rights, encompassing dress, sexual expression, and abolishing the sexual double standard. She lived by her ideals, frequently wearing pants and bearing a third child, Luis, out of wedlock in 1911. She insisted "that women must acquire greater freedom and rights," advocating better education for girls and abolition of traditional marriage, which she characterized as "slavery".	2016-08-25 17:40:12.533238	\N	f	t	1	https://scontent-lga3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xpf1/v/t1.0-9/11817065_458208327719808_8056215541667040836_n.jpg?oh=da7e6571d5757ebbe11ab351ecebe3c4&oe=57B771AF

158	Julia	Child	1912	2004	https://www.womenofthehall.org/	158	Julia Child’s forty years as America’s leading chef began in Boston in 1963 on public television station WGBH. Invited to the studio to discuss her first book, Mastering the Art of French Cooking, she brought along eggs and utensils to make an on-the-air omelet for the television host. Her breezy manner, unique voice, and relaxed chatter made her an instant hit and launched her acclaimed television series, The French Chef.\nJulia McWilliams grew up in a well-to-do family with a younger brother and sister, all three over six feet tall, which caused their mother to boast, “I gave birth to 18 feet of children.” After graduating from Smith College in 1934 she worked in a series of positions in advertising and journalism. Following the outbreak of World War II, she took a position with the Office of Strategic Services, hoping to become a spy, but became instead a file clerk in Ceylon, now Sri Lanka.\nAfter the war she married Paul Cushing Child, a diplomat with the foreign service. Her husband was soon posted to France and en route to Paris, he took her to the oldest restaurant in the country, La Couronne. This was her first experience with classical French cuisine and she fell in love. “The whole experience was an opening up of the soul and spirit for me . . . I was hooked, and for life, as it turned out.” After this experience, Child became devoted to French cuisine. She enrolled in the famous Le Cordon Bleu cooking school and explored the markets and bistros of Paris to refine her techniques. In 1951, she opened a cooking school, L”Ecole des Trois Gourmandes, (The School of the Three Gourmandes) with two partners. This venture led to the comprehensive French cooking manual for the American public, Mastering the Art of French Cooking, considered at the time to be the best English language cookbook.\nSoon after the publication, the couple moved from Paris to Cambridge, Massachusetts. The French Chef television series began in 1963 and went on to become an outstanding public television success. Child won a Peabody Award in 1965, followed by an Emmy the next year. She only accepted $50.00 a show, donating the rest of her salary to the television station. She starred in eight television cooking series and published 11 cookbooks. She was the first woman to be inducted into the Culinary Institute of America’s Hall of Fame. In 1978, she founded the educational American Institute of Wine and Food in Napa, California.\nAn honorary doctorate from Harvard University, received in 1993, read in part, “A Harvard friend and neighbor who has filled the air with common sense and uncommon scents. Long may her souffles rise.” In 2001, Child received the coveted Legion of Honor from the French government, and in 2003 the Presidential Medal of Freedom from President George W. Bush. Her famous television kitchen was placed in the Smithsonian Institute in Washington, DC.\n\n	2016-08-25 17:40:12.811357	\N	f	t	1	https://www.womenofthehall.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/julia-child-205x254.jpg	
145	Rachel	Carson	1907	1964	https://www.womenofthehall.org/	145	A shy young woman who loved books and nature equally well, Rachel Carson trained as a zoologist. She joined the Fish and Wildlife Service in Washington to work on their publications. In 1951 she came to national prominence when her book, The Sea Around Us, topped the best seller list for 86 weeks. Her graceful prose opened up scientific knowledge about the oceans to the layperson. An earlier work, Under the Sea Wind, was reissued. When she studied marine life in Maine for her next book, The Edge of the Sea, she stayed for hours wading in icy tidal pools until she was so numb with cold she had to be carried out. She was not by nature a crusader, but when aerial spraying of DDT killed the birds in a friend’s bird sanctuary, she began to investigate the effects of pesticides on the chain of life. “The environment” and “ecology” have since become household words for Americans, but it all began with her Silent Spring in 1962. Driven by the knowledge that the book was desperately needed, she pored over and combined the work of many individual researchers. She wrote of the heedless pesticide poisoning of our rivers and soils, warning that we might soon face a spring when no bird songs could be heard. Rachel Carson had to weather a storm of controversy and abuse, and she did not live to see the eventual banning of DDT. But the environmentalist movement carries on the work she began, preserving our natural heritage for the future. 	2016-08-25 17:40:12.585817	\N	f	t	1	https://www.womenofthehall.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/rachel-carson-205x220.jpg

147	Hattie	Carthan	1900	1984	www.nycgovparks.org/	147	Hattie Carthan was a Bedford-Stuyvesant resident who always had an interest in trees. When she noticed conditions in her neighborhood beginning to deteriorate, Mrs. Carthan began replanting trees there, and in the process, helped found the Bedford-Stuyvesant Neighborhood Tree Corps and the Green Guerillas. The Tree Corps began in 1971 as a way to teach young people how to care for trees. As a volunteer organization providing supplies, advice, and encouragement for all types of urban community green spaces, the Green Guerillas were the force behind the resurgence of the community garden movement in the 1970s. The organization began informally in 1974 with tactics as simple as throwing water balloons filled with seeds into abandoned lots; the positive response showed the overwhelming need for more green space in the inner city. Mrs. Carthan also led the charge to preserve a particular Southern magnolia tree that became a symbol of the neighborhood. The tree, rare in the northeast, was brought on a ship from North Carolina in 1885. Carthan not only succeeded in having a wall built to protect the tree but also spearheaded the successful attempt to designate it an official city landmark in 1970. It is one of only two trees to be designated as such (and after the 1998 death of the Weeping beech in Queens, the only tree still standing). Carthan continued her campaign by convincing the City to convert three nearby abandoned homes into the Magnolia Tree Earth Center.\n	2016-08-25 17:40:12.624655	\N	f	t	1		
148	Mary Ann Shadd 	Cary	1823	1893	https://www.womenofthehall.org/	148	Mary Ann Shadd Cary, born in Wilmington, Delaware, the eldest of 13 children of free African-American parents became a role model for women in education and law.  After receiving an education from Pennsylvania Quakers, Cary devoted the first part of her life to abolition, working with fugitive slaves, and becoming the first African-American woman in North America to edit a weekly newspaper — the Provincial Freeman, devoted to displaced Americans living in Canada.\nShe then became a teacher, establishing or teaching in schools for African Americans in Wilmington; West Chester, Pennsylvania; New York; Morristown, New Jersey; and Canada. She was also the first woman to speak at a national African-American convention. During the Civil War, Cary helped recruit African-American soldiers for the Union Army. She then taught in Washington, D.C., public schools until, in 1869, she embarked on her second career, becoming the first woman to enter Howard University’s law school.  She was the first African-American woman to obtain a law degree and among the first women in the United States to do so.\nShe then fought alongside Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton for women’s suffrage, testifying before the Judiciary Committee of the House of Representatives and becoming the first African-American woman to cast a vote in a national election.  As an educator, an abolitionist, an editor, an attorney and a feminist, she dedicated her life to improving the quality of life for everyone — black and white, male and female.\n\n	2016-08-25 17:40:12.63663	\N	f	t	1	https://www.womenofthehall.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/mary-ann-shadd-cary-205x245.jpg	
159	Maria Lydia	Child	1802	1880	https://www.womenofthehall.org/	159	The youngest of seven children born to an abolitionist family, Lydia Maria Child (1802-1880) spent her life advocating for the rights of slaves and women.\nGiven the title “The First Lady of the Republic” by admirers including abolitionist William Lloyd Garrison, Child’s writings dispelled ideas that African-Americans were a lower class. Her book An Appeal in Favor of that Class of Americans Called Africans, advocated education for African Americans and has often been cited as the first anti-slavery publication. She joined the American Anti-Slavery Society and she and her husband edited the National Anti-Slavery Standard from 1841-1844.\nChild was also a founding member of the Massachusetts Women’s Suffrage Association and authored The History of the Conditions of Women in Various Ages and Nations, a publication that went on to influence the next generation of suffragists.\nIn addition to her activist work, Child also founded the country’s first children’s magazine, Juvenile Miscellany, and wrote many volumes dedicated to domestic endeavors.\n	2016-08-25 17:40:12.831931	\N	f	t	1	https://www.womenofthehall.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/lydia-maria-child-205x291.jpg	
149	Mary	Cassatt	1844	1926	https://www.womenofthehall.org/	149	In the nineteenth century many young women of wealthy background dabbled in painting to while away their leisure hours. Mary Cassatt took it seriously. She came from a well-to-do family and lived in Europe for several years when she was a child. When, at twenty-two, she declared she could learn no more in Philadelphia, her parents let her return to Europe. In Rome, Seville, Antwerp, and Paris, she studied the masters’ techniques. She sharpened her skills by copying Corregio, Rubens, and Franz Hals.\nCassatt was in Paris at that extraordinary moment when the Impressionists first overturned established artistic standards. They recognized in her a kindred spirit and a powerful talent, and she was invited to exhibit in the Impressionist shows. “I accepted with joy,” she recalled. “I took leave of conventional art. I began to live.”\nShe never married. In 1877 her parents moved to Europe to join her, and for the next eighteen years she was obliged to devote some of her time to their care. Surrounded by bourgeois respectability, she painted what she saw: interiors, gardens, and portraits, especially of mothers and children.\nMary Cassatt was self-disciplined, intense, and outspoken. She never did commissioned portraits, accepted no pupils, and refused to paint “pot-boilers.” Her influence on American art carried beyond her own work because she gave advice to American art collectors. The famed Havemeyer collection, now part of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, began when Mary Cassatt convinced young Lousiane Havemeyer to spend all her schoolgirl allowance on a Degas pastel.\n\n	2016-08-25 17:40:12.662573	\N	f	t	1	https://www.womenofthehall.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/mary-cassatt-205x290.jpg	
991	Matilda	Steinam Kubie	1869	1944		984	In 1917, Kubie became chair of publicity for the newly formed Federation for the Support of Jewish Philanthropic Societies of New York City, an organization dedicated to coordinating and supporting the activities of Jewish charities. During her long association with the federation, she served as associate chair of the women’s division, director of the Business Men’s Council in 1920, and honorary trustee-at-large for life. Her accomplishments in these roles were manifold: She obtained free advertising space in the newspaper ads of department stores, on outdoor billboards, in the programs of Carnegie Hall and the Metropolitan Opera House, and during the broadcasts of several radio stations, including the municipally owned WNYC. Within five years after joining the federation, Kubie was on the boards of the Young Women’s Hebrew Association, the Beth-El Sisterhood, and the Jewish Big Sisters, and had become the membership secretary of the Jewish Women’s Organization. In 1922, Bird S. Coler, commissioner of New York City’s Department of Public Welfare, recognized Kubie’s work by appointing her an honorary deputy to assist in relations between the department and agencies that cared for Jewish dependents. Kubie was the only woman to hold such a post.	2016-08-26 19:29:37.376789	\N	f	t	1	\N	\N
151	Willa Sibert 	Cather	1873	1947	https://www.womenofthehall.org/	151	As an adolescent, Willa Cather defied the norms for girls: she cut her hair short, wore trousers, and openly rebelled against the roles girls were supposed to play. At the University of Nebraska at Lincoln, she edited the school magazine and published articles and play reviews in local papers. After graduating, she languished awhile in Red Cloud until she was offered a position editing Home Monthly in Pittsburgh. While editing that magazine, she wrote short stories to fill its pages. These stories, published in a collection called the Troll Garden in 1905, brought her to the attention of S.S. McClure. She became a member of the staff of McClure’s Magazine and finally, its editor.\nIn 1912, after five years with McClure’s, she left the magazine to have time for her own writing. She subsequently published her first five novels. These novels announced her themes of strong women, the fight against provincial life, and the dying of the pioneer tradition. This was the period of O Pioneers (1913), Song of the Lark (1915), My Antonia (1918), One of Ours (1922), and A Lost Lady (1922). She won the Pulitzer Prize for One of Ours. After this prolific period, Cather entered a period of despair. It was a time, she said, when the world broke apart. Recovering from this difficult period, she wrote her greatest novels: The Professor’s House (1925), My Mortal Enemy (1926), Death Comes for the Archbishop (1927), and “Shadows on the Rock” (1931). These works are the best example of her classic and restrained language and her lyrical evocation of nature.\nThere always seemed to exist a tension in Willa Cather’s life and, thus, in her writing. She was drawn to the East coast, its mountains and cities. And, she was drawn to the plains and the vastness of Nebraska. She loved the romantic literature of France, yet her own writing style was one of classic restraint.\nMost of her work is autobiographical in nature, yet before she died she ordered her letters burned so no one could have access to her. She had a large circle of friends, yet to write she needed the solitude of Nebraska or New Hampshire. Red Cloud, Nebraska, her home, both attracted and repelled her; it was also the source of her art.\n\n	2016-08-25 17:40:12.683153	\N	f	t	1	https://www.womenofthehall.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/willa-cather-205x179.jpg	
154	Carrie Chapman	Catt	1859	1947		154	"Key coordinator of the suffrage movement and skillful political strategist, Carrie (Lane) Chapman Catt revitalized the National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA) and played a leading role in its successful campaign to win voting rights for women.\nCarrie Lane was born in Wisconsin in 1859. At the age of seven, her family moved to Iowa, where Lane began preparatory schooling. In 1880, she graduated from Iowa State College at the top of her class, having worked her way through school by washing dishes, working in the school library, and teaching. After college, she worked as a law clerk, a school teacher, and a principal in Mason City, Iowa. In 1883, at the age of twenty-four, she became one of the first women to be appointed superintendent of schools.\nIn February 1885, Lane married Leo Chapman, editor and publisher of the Mason City Republican, who died of typhoid fever the following year in San Francisco, California, where he had gone seeking new employment. Arriving a few days after her husband's death, the young widow decided to remain in San Francisco, where she eked out a living as the city's first female newspaper reporter. In 1887, Chapman returned to Charles City, Iowa, and joined the Iowa Woman Suffrage Association for whom she worked as a professional writer and lecturer. After a short period of time, she became the group's recording secretary. From 1890 to 1892, she served as the Iowa association's state organizer.\nIn June 1890, Chapman married George Catt, a fellow Iowa State alumnus she had met during her stay in San Francisco who encouraged her suffrage activity. During this time, Catt also began work nationally for the National American Woman Suffrage Association, speaking in 1890 at its Washington, D.C., convention. In the following months, Catt's work, and her writing and speaking engagements established her reputation as a leading suffragist. In 1892, she was asked by Susan B. Anthony to address Congress on the proposed suffrage amendment. In 1900, she succeeded Anthony as NAWSA president. From then on, her time was spent primarily in speechmaking, planning campaigns, organizing women, and gaining political experience. In 1902, Catt helped to organize the International Woman Suffrage Alliance (IWSA), which eventually incorporated sympathetic associations in thirty-two nations. In 1904, she resigned her NAWSA presidency in order to care for her ailing husband. Grief-stricken over the dual deaths of George Catt (October 1905) and Susan B. Anthony (February 1906), Catt was encouraged by her doctor and her friends to travel abroad. As a result, she spent much of the following nine years as IWSA president promoting equal-suffrage rights worldwide.\nIn 1915, Catt returned to the United States to resume the leadership of NAWSA.. In 1916, at a NAWSA convention in Atlantic City, New Jersey, Catt unveiled her "Winning Plan" to campaign simultaneously for suffrage on both the state and federal levels, and to compromise for partial suffrage in the states resisting change. Under Catt's dynamic leadership, NAWSA won the backing of the House and Senate, as well as state support for the amendment's ratification. In 1917, New York passed a state woman suffrage referendum, and by 1918, President Woodrow Wilson was finally converted to the cause. On August 26, 1920, the Nineteenth Amendment officially became part of the United States Constitution. Stepping down from the presidency of NAWSA after its victory, Catt continued her work for equal suffrage, founding the new League of Women Voters, and serving as its honorary president for the rest of her life. In 1923, she published Woman Suffrage and Politics: The Inner Story of the Suffrage Movement. In her later years, Catt's interests broadened to include the causes of world peace and child labor. She founded the National Committee on the Cause and Cure of War, serving as its chairperson until 1932, and honorary chair thereafter. She also actively supported the League of Nations. Honored and praised by countless institutions for her half-century of public service, Carrie Chapman Catt died of heart failure in New Rochelle, New York, on March 9, 1947." \n \n	2016-08-25 17:40:12.729558	\N	f	f	1	https://www.womenofthehall.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/carrie-chapman-catt-205x257.jpg

161	Shirley	Chisholm	1924	2005		161	Shirley Chisholm was Brooklyn-born  and educated at Brooklyn College and Columbia University. Chisholm became the first African American congresswoman in 1968, representing New York State in the U.S. House of Representatives for seven terms. In 1972, she ran for the Democratic nomination for the presidency with the slogan “Unbought and Unbossed.” Chisholm became the first major-party African American candidate for the U.S. presidency and won 152 delegates at the Democratic Convention. \nIn her speech announcing her candidacy, she states, “I stand before you today as a candidate for the Presidency of the United States of America. I am not the candidate of Black America, although I am Black and proud. I am not the candidate of the women’s movement of this country, although I am a woman and I am equally proud of that. I am not the candidate of any political bosses or fat cats or special interests … I am the candidate of the people of America. And my presence before you now symbolizes a new era in American political history.” Towards what would ultimately be the end of that campaign run, she went on to say, “I am a candidate for the Presidency of the United States. I make that statement proudly, in the full knowledge that, as a black person and as a female person, I do not have a chance of actually gaining that office in this election year. I make that statement seriously, knowing that my candidacy itself can change the face and future of American politics — that it will be important to the needs and hopes of every one of you — even though, in the conventional sense, I will not win.” 	2016-08-25 17:40:12.864595	\N	f	t	1	http://static1.squarespace.com/static/5522b4f7e4b03b1d22454063/55cb89a5e4b08dc9acaa06cf/55cb89a5e4b08dc9acaa06d8/1439489344609/800px-Shirley_Chisholm.jpg?format=300w	http://bit.ly/1SUL7fV

Initially active in politics as a young Republican, she received her bachelor’s with honors in Political Science, was valedictorian, and the first student in Wellesley history to deliver a commencement address. Deeply affected by the death of Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr., whom she had met in 1962, and by her experience attending the “Wellesley in Washington” program, she joined the Democratic Party.\nClinton received her juris doctorate from Yale Law School, where she served on the Board of the Yale Review of Law and Social Action and where she met Bill Clinton in 1974. Clinton joined the Rose Law Firm in 1976, specializing in intellectual property issues, and providing pro bono work in child advocacy cases.\nAs First Lady of Arkansas, she continued to practice law, and chaired the Arkansas Educational Standards Commission and the Rural Health Advisory Committee. As First Lady of the United States (1993 – 2001), she chaired the Task Force on National Health Care Reform that recommended the Clinton Health Care Plan. The controversy over her public role in leading health care policy reform was intense, but she continued as a staunch advocate of health care reform, women’s and children’s issues, arts, culture, and heritage promotion, throughout the Clinton Presidency. She is the author of Living History and It Takes a Village.\nIn 2007, Clinton entered the Democratic primary race for the 2008 Presidency by posting “I’m in. And I’m in to win.” on her website. In June 2008, Clinton conceded the primary race to eventual winner Barack Obama, but not before putting “18,000,000 cracks in the glass ceiling.” In December of that same year, President-elect Obama nominated Clinton to serve as Secretary of State, making her just the third woman to hold the Cabinet position. In 2015, Clinton is a candidate for the Democratic Party’s nomination for U.S. President.\nAlong with Eleanor Roosevelt, Clinton is credited with substantively redefining the role of First Lady and opening new pathways for women in political leadership.\n\n	2016-08-25 17:40:12.924117	\N	f	t	1	https://www.womenofthehall.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/hillary-rodham-clinton-205x256.jpg	
166	Mildred	Cohn	1913	2009	https://www.womenofthehall.org/	166	A groundbreaking scientist in several important areas of biological study, Mildred Cohn pioneered research that helped form the scientific understanding of mechanisms of enzymatic reactions and the methods of studying them. She was born in 1913 in New York City to Russian immigrant parents and was educated in the city’s public schools.\nCohn earned her bachelor of arts degree from Hunter College in 1931 and her Ph.D. in chemistry from Columbia University in 1937. It was at this point that Cohn shifted fields from physical to biological chemistry. She served as the first female research associate in the laboratory of Vincent du Vigneaud at Cornell Medical College from 1938-1946.\nIn 1946, Cohn moved to the biochemistry department of Washington University in St. Louis, where she introduced the use of isotopic oxygen 18 to study metabolic processes and enzyme mechanisms. She later applied nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) to investigate metabolism and metabolic intermediates.\nIn 1960, Cohn accepted an associate professorship at the University of Pennsylvania, and in 1961, became Professor of Biochemistry and Biophysics. She continued at the university until 1982. In 1971, Cohn chaired a faculty committee on The Status of Women on the Faculty. The report released by the committee led to many positive changes for female professors and faculty members.\nFollowing her retirement from the University of Pennsylvania, Cohn served as a senior member of the Fox Chase Cancer Center. She returned to research work at the University of Pennsylvania on a part time basis and continued until 1998.\nCohn published more than 150 scientific papers and received several awards for her pioneering work on magnetic resonance in biological systems. Most notably, Cohn received the National Medal of Science in 1982 in biological sciences for “pioneering the use of stable isotopic tracers and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy in the study of the mechanisms of enzymatic catalysis.” She was the first female biochemist to receive the National Medal of Science.\n\n	2016-08-25 17:40:12.948104	\N	f	t	1	https://www.womenofthehall.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/mildred-cohn.jpg

167	Bessie	Coleman	1892	1926	https://www.womenofthehall.org/	167	The world’s first African American woman aviator, Bessie Coleman, earned her pilot’s license in 1921 in France, two years before her more famous contemporary, Amelia Earhart.\nBessie Coleman, the tenth child in a family of thirteen, grew up in a large, single-parent family in rural Texas. She learned about aviation through childhood reading, finished high school and some teacher’s college training, and moved to Chicago. There, she was mentored by two African-American philanthropists, Robert Abbott and Jesse Binga. Denied admission to American aviation schools because of her race and gender, she learned French and went to France. In 1921 she earned an international pilot’s license from the highly respected Federation Aeronautique International.\nShe returned to the United States and spent the next five years touring the country, giving exhibition flights, barnstorming and parachuting at airports. Earning the nickname Queen Bess, she challenged the barriers of racial discrimination and refused to participate in segregated events. She planned to open an aviation school to teach other African Americans to fly and become an active part of the growing aviation industry.\nTragically, her life and dream ended in her untimely death on April 30, 1926 during an exhibition accident when she fell from the plane and died instantly. She left a substantial legacy because of her modeling a pathway for women and people of color in aviation, and her challenges to Jim Crow practices. Bessie Coleman is honored every year by African American pilots dropping a wreath from the air over her gravesite.\n\n	2016-08-25 17:40:12.968743	\N	f	t	1	https://www.womenofthehall.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/bessie-coleman-205x267.jpg	
168	Eileen	Collins	1956		https://www.womenofthehall.org/	168	Eileen Collins was launched into history when she became the first American woman to pilot a spacecraft. Of this trailblazing mission, Collins said, “This mission marks the first baby steps in international space cooperation.”\nCollins worked hard and overcame adversity every inch of the way on her journey to space. Her family struggled to make ends meet in upstate New York, and she put herself through community college and paid for flying lessons by working full time in a variety of jobs. Collins learned to fly when she was only 19: “I didn”t spend money on clothes…I”d grown up watching gliders fly off Harris Hill (in Elmira, New York) and I”d always dreamed of flying.” She graduated from Syracuse University with a bachelor’s in mathematics and economics, and obtained a master’s in operations research from Stanford University in 1986. She also holds a master’s in space systems management from Webster University. From 1986 to 1989, Collins was a math instructor at the Air Force Academy. During that time, she was also a test pilot at Edwards Air Force base, flying 26 different aircraft in a single year.\nIn 1990, Collins was selected by NASA and became an astronaut in July 1991. Collins became the first woman to pilot a space shuttle, when Discovery completed an eight-day mission in February 1995. That mission included the first space rendezvous with the Russian space station Mir. Collins made history again in 1999, when she commanded the Columbia, for mission STS-93. Throughout her career, Collins has logged over 6,751 hours in 30 different types of aircraft.\nRetired from NASA since 2006, Collins has received numerous awards including the Distinguished Flying Cross, Defense Meritorious Service Medal, French Legion of Honor, NASA Outstanding Leadership Medal, Free Spirit Award, and the National Space Trophy.\nCollins is well aware of the pioneering nature of her work: “I want to do well because I know that I”m representing other women, other pilots, military pilots as well as civilian pilots who are hoping to come here to NASA and be pilots themselves for the space shuttle.”\n\n	2016-08-25 17:40:12.997611	\N	f	t	1	https://www.womenofthehall.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/eileen-collins-205x261.jpg	
169	Ruth	Colvin	1917		https://www.womenofthehall.org/	169	Ruth Johnson Colvin saw a problem – pervasive adult illiteracy – and used formidable organizing skills and tenacity to help solve it through the creation of Literacy Volunteers of America, Inc.\nColvin learned the scope of illiteracy in l962 when she discovered that more than 11,000 people in the upstate New York county where she lived could not read.  Her life was transformed as she undertook the necessary training needed to help correct the situation.\nShe determined that traditional classroom methods would not work and instead focused on the development of community networks in which a climate was created that empowered adult learners in new ways.  The organization developed tutor training programs, special materials, community support components and a model that involves people from all walks of life in a community.  Former dropouts became tutors, as did bank presidents, educators and many others. In 2002, Literacy Volunteers of America, Inc. merged with Laubach Literacy International to form ProLiteracy Worldwide.  Of her sometimes daunting work, Colvin has said, “If you believe in your idea, you go from there.  If you do it with love, it will work out.”\nDuring her more than over four decades of literacy work, Colvin has published nine books, and visited or worked in more than sixty countries.  In 2006, she was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom from President George W.

She is a microbiologist, marine expert and internationally recognized authority on cholera and infectious diseases. Dr. Colwell has pioneered the expanding role of women and minorities in science from Bangladesh to America, and a dynamic understanding of complex systems, integrated data, and the multi-level interplay among the earth’s systems.\nIn developing nations, Dr. Colwell used “high-tech analyses to produce extremely low-tech solutions.” Researching the environmental aspects of cholera outbreaks with new tracking techniques, Colwell and her colleagues developed locally based, inexpensive filtration methods to remove the plankton associated with cholera bacteria that are responsible for high death rates in poverty-stricken countries. They taught women a simple, folded-sari-cloth filtration technique of water purification to reduce the incidence of cholera by 50%. The global impact on reduction of mortality from cholera infection is profound.\nDr. Colwell became the eleventh Director of the National Science Foundation in 1998, the first woman to become Director and the first biologist.

993	Margaret	Corbin	1751	1800		986	Things were so precarious in the fall of 1776, the dawn of the Revolution, that anyone who lived in New York might have turned the tide of war. Many women did their part to battle the British. But Corbin is notable not just for particular bravery but for sacrifice; she continued to lob cannon fire at the British from Fort Washington in today’s Washington Heights well after her husband was killed. Corbin herself was later imprisoned by the British. Today the street along Fort Tryon is named for her.	2016-08-26 19:33:56.683793	\N	f	t	1	http://www.boweryboyshistory.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/corbin.jpg	\N
172	Joan Ganz 	Cooney	1929		https://www.womenofthehall.org/	172	Joan Ganz Cooney, as creator of Sesame Street, has benefited millions of young children.\nAfter graduating from the University of Arizona, Cooney worked as a newspaper reporter. In 1954, she moved to New York City to write for television. In 1964, she received an award for her analysis of the antipoverty program in New York. That same year, after studying the use of television for preschool education and successfully soliciting over $8 million in funding, Cooney founded the Children’s Television Workshop and created Sesame Street.\nDebuting in 1969, Sesame Street won numerous awards and is still seen by millions of children around the world. In some places, Sesame Street provides preschool children with their only structured opportunity to develop learning skills. Not only has the program enhanced preschool children’s understanding of the fundamentals of reading, but it has helped them appreciate the world and the variety of people in it.\nCooney’s research on poverty, education, and on children’s inquisitive nature, along with her creativity, led to this television program of unequaled success. Perhaps no other woman in the late 20th century has influenced the education of children as much as Joan Ganz Cooney.\n\n	2016-08-25 17:40:13.066523	\N	f	t	1	https://www.womenofthehall.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/joan-ganz-cooney-205x288.jpg	
173	Anna J.	Cooper	1858	1964	http://www.blackpast.org/aah/cooper-anna-julia-haywood-1858-1964	173	Anna Julia Haywood Cooper was a writer, teacher, and activist who championed education for African Americans and women. In 1867, two years after the end of the Civil War, Anna began her formal education at Saint Augustine’s Normal School and Collegiate Institute, a coeducational facility built for former slaves. There she received the equivalent of a high school education. Anna Haywood married George A.G. Cooper, a teacher of theology at Saint Augustine’s, in 1877.  When her husband died in 1879, Cooper decided to pursue a college degree. She attended Oberlin College in Ohio on a tuition scholarship, earning a BA in 1884 and a Masters in Mathematics in 1887. After graduation Cooper worked at Wilberforce University and Saint Augustine’s before moving to Washington, D.C. to teach at Washington Colored High School. She met another teacher, Mary Church (Terrell), who, along with Cooper, boarded at the home of Alexander Crummell, a prominent clergyman, intellectual, and proponent of African American emigration to Liberia. Cooper published her first book, A Voice from the South by a Black Woman of the South, in 1892. In addition to calling for equal education for women, A Voice from the South advanced Cooper’s assertion that educated African American women were necessary for uplifting the entire black race. The book of essays gained national attention, and Cooper began lecturing across the country on topics such as education, civil rights, and the status of black women. In 1902, Cooper began a controversial stint as principal of M Street High School (formerly Washington Colored High). The white Washington, D.C. school board disagreed with her educational approach for black students, which focused on college preparation, and she resigned in 1906.  In addition to working to advance African American educational opportunities, Cooper also established and co-founded several organizations to promote black civil rights causes. She helped found the Colored Women’s League in 1892, and she joined the executive committee of the first Pan-African Conference in 1900. Since the Young Women’s Christian Association (YWCA) and the Young Men’s Christian Association (YMCA) did not accept African American members, she created “colored” branches to provide support for young black migrants moving from the South into Washington, D.C. Cooper resumed graduate study in 1911 at Columbia University in New York City, New York. She returned to school in 1924 when she enrolled at the University of Paris in France. In 1925, at the age of 67, Cooper became the fourth African American woman to obtain a Doctorate of Philosophy. In 1930, Cooper retired from teaching to assume the presidency of Frelinghuysen University, a school for black adults. She served as the school’s registrar after it was reorganized into the Frelinghuysen Group of Schools for Colored People. Cooper remained in that position until the school closed in the 1950s.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               	2016-08-25 17:40:13.090532	\N	f	t	1	http://prof.chicanas.com/20/?page_id=632	http://www.msnbc.com/melissa-harris-perry/watch/how-anna-julia-cooper-shaped-civil-womens-rights-19273283939

175	Mother Marianne 	Cope	1838	1918	https://www.womenofthehall.org/	175	Barbara Koob was born in Heppenheim, Germany. In 1839, her family immigrated to the United States and settled in Utica, NY. As soon as she completed school, she supported her family from 1853 – 1862. She then entered the Sisters of the Third Order of St. Francis in Syracuse, NY and became known as Sister Marianne. She held a variety of leadership positions in her religious community and at upstate New York schools.\nIn 1866, she helped found St. Elizabeth’s Hospital in Utica, NY and in 1869 became the primary founder of St. Joseph’s Hospital in Syracuse, NY: two hospitals that were among the first 50 hospitals founded in the United States. The St. Joseph’s Hospital Charter stated: “In the admittance and treatment of patients, no distinction shall be made because of theological belief, nationality or color.”\nSaint Marianne became the Administrator of St. Joseph’s in 1870, a pioneering advocate for patient’s rights, sanitation and hygiene. The College of Medicine of Syracuse University was moved from Geneva, NY to Syracuse because of the training opportunities available to doctors at St. Joseph’s Hospital, and Mother Marianne admitted the medical students and initiated their clinical instruction.\nIn 1874, her policy was “the wishes of the patients with regard to their being brought before the medical students should be respected in every case.” Responding to an appeal from the King and Queen of Hawaii, Saint Marianne and six other Sisters of St. Francis arrived in Honolulu in late 1883. In four years, they transformed the Kakaako Branch Hospital for those with leprosy from an unsanitary institution plagued by vermin into a hospital compound with beautiful grounds and cottages, where people were treated with dignity.\nIn 1884, Saint Marianne founded the Malulani Hospital, the first general hospital on Maui. The next year, she founded the Kapiolani Home in Honolulu for the healthy female children of persons with leprosy, most likely the first institution of its kind in the world. In 1888, she arrived at the remote settlement on Molokai’s Kalaupapa peninsula, a desolate place where individuals of all ages challenged by leprosy had been abandoned by society. She established the Bishop Home for single women, providing a safe, affirming environment. Her influence spread to all of Kalaupapa, slowly transforming it from a place of abandonment and despair to a community of hope and dignity.\nMore than 130 years later, her philosophy of seeing value in every individual and promoting a “quality of life spirit”, ensuring human rights and individual dignity, belonging and community, still resonates today. Her vision that those marginalized by society be afforded opportunities and access to health care, dignity and equal treatment, is manifested in the St. Joseph Hospital Center of Syracuse, St. Elizabeth’s of Utica, in Hawaii’s St. Francis Medical System “hospital without walls”, and in the Kalaupapa National Historical Park.\n\n	2016-08-25 17:40:13.121995	\N	f	t	1	https://www.womenofthehall.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/mother-marianne-cope-205x290.jpg	
176	Rhonda	Copelon	1944	2010	http://ccrjustice.org/	176	Rhonda Copelon, a CUNY School of Law professor and human rights attorney with and Vice-President of the Center for Constitutional Rights, was a human rights leader who broke new ground opening U.S. federal courts and international tribunals to gender-based violence and international human rights violations.\n\nCopelon was noted for her key role in the landmark human rights case, Filártiga v. Peña-Irala, which established that victims of gross human rights abuses committed abroad had recourse to U.S. Courts. Additionally, she was a champion of women’s reproductive health and argued before the Supreme Court in Harris v. McRae, in which the Court narrowly upheld the Hyde Amendment which prohibited Medicaid reimbursement for almost all abortions. Remarkably both the Filártiga and McCrae decisions came down on June 30, 1980.\n\nOver the course of her 12 years on staff at CCR, Copelon challenged racial discrimination, government wiretapping, and worked on several landmark cases including Filártiga. She also argued before the Supreme Court in Drew v. Andrews, in support of African-American women plaintiffs who were denied teaching jobs because of the Mississippi Drew municipal school district policy that barred parents of out-of-wedlock children from all but janitorial positions. In this challenge to this moralistic and punitive policy, young unwed mothers won their case and their jobs back at the Supreme Court based on a claim of marital discrimination.\n\nDeeply distressed by the majority’s cruel interpretation of the Constitution in McRae, but heartened by the door opened on the same day by the Filártiga case, Copelon turned to international human rights as a basis for protection of rights of women and the poor.\n\nIn 1983, Copelon was a founding faculty member of CUNY Law, and in 1992 she co-founded the Law School’s International Women’s Human Rights Clinic (IWHR). She cofounded the Women’s Caucus for Gender Justice and through her role as secretariat and as the Director of IWHR, she coordinated an effort with partners across the globe ensuring that the Rome Statute was written to take gender into account concerning the crimes, procedure and evidence and composition of the Court and personnel. In particular, as a result of her tireless passion and work with partnering organizations, the International Criminal Court instead codified sexual and gender crimes as being part of their jurisdiction.\n\n“Rhonda had a fiery passion to bring justice to all the oppressed and abused women of the world."\n~Peter Weiss, Vice President of CCR and co-counsel in Filártiga\n\n“Rhonda was a true fighter who through the years has shown me her unconditional love for human kind and her effusive desire for the equal rights of all beings. Without her, there would not be a Filártiga principle. She was the pillar that held me throughout the toughest times of my life.”\n~ Dolly Filártiga, the plaintiff in the case that bore her family name and who became her dear friend\n\n“It was hearing Rhonda speaking about Harris v. McCrae at Yale Law School that inspired me to come to CCR in the first place.”\n~ Professor David Cole, of Georgetown University Law Center, a leading constitutional scholar and CCR alumni and current board member	2016-08-25 17:40:13.141206	\N	f	t	1	http://ccrjustice.org/files/images/rhonda-copelon-fund_w163_h540.png

178	Gerty Theresa Randitz 	Cori	1896	1957	https://www.womenofthehall.org/	178	Gerty Theresa Randitz Cori, a pioneer in biochemistry, received international recognition for discovering, along with her husband, Carl, how glucose is converted into glycogen, a process dubbed the Cori Cycle. Her research had a profound effect on the treatment of diabetes, allowing physicians to understand how the body stores glucose by converting it into glycogen stored energy, which can be used when the body’s reserves run low. In 1947, she and her husband, along with Bernardo A. Houssay, received the Nobel Prize for Physiology and Medicine for this discovery.\nCori’s later studies on enzymes and hormones further advanced research in the treatment of diabetes and contributed to our understanding that missing enzymes indicate defective genes. This laid the foundation for future studies of genetic defects in humans.\nCori received her M.D. at the German University of Prague in 1920 and came to the United States in the 1920s. Despite her significant research, she had to fight discrimination and nepotism rules. Finally, in 1947, the same year she became the first American woman and the third worldwide to receive a Nobel Prize in the sciences as well as the first woman to be awarded the prize in Physiology or Medicine, she was named a full professor of biochemistry at Washington University in St. Louis.

190	Dorothy	Davis			www.womensenews.org	190	Dorothy Davis: Transcontinental Developer of African Economic Justice\n\n\nDorothy Davis has been a pioneer all of her life.\n\nBorn in Liberia to U.S. Foreign Service parents, her family moved to New Jersey from their posting in newly independent Tunisia when she was entering third grade. Prior to their arrival, the headmaster of the private school of her parents' choice assured them she would be welcome. However, when the school saw that Davis was African American, they informed her parents that private schools in the state did not admit African Americans. Her parents sued the state and Davis became the first black person, and black female, to attend a private school in New Jersey.\n\nSince multicultural school environments had been her norm overseas, Davis was unaware of her double minority status in U.S. classrooms full of boys. She remained the first African American female to attend her schools in Washington, D.C., and Switzerland until her senior year at an all-female high school in New Jersey.\n\n"That's when I became more cognizant of the leadership capabilities of women," she said.\n\nDavis' mobile upbringing required her to readily adapt to new environments. She continues this lifestyle today and her "collage" of experiences and networks informs her vocation.\n\nAfter working in media (Fortune magazine), nongovernmental organizations (African American Institute), multilateral organizations (the U.N.) and with governments and the private sector, Davis founded The Diasporan Touch. Through the organization, she specializes in finding common ground between people, cultures and interests to produce positive, effective and sustainable results.\n\n"I empower people by helping them identify their talent and discover how it can contribute to a unique solution to a certain circumstance or opportunity," she said.\n\nA strong proponent of gender balance and human rights, Davis is a founding board member of the Sirleaf Market Women's Fund and currently chairs its international board of directors. Leveraging the resilience of female traders during Liberia's 14-year civil war, the organization builds or renovates markets, provides literacy and financial training and advocates for market women in policymaking spaces worldwide.\n\nNext, Davis wants to inspire youth to take the road less traveled through writing a book that features her eclectic journey. She wants to encourage them to become social entrepreneurs dedicated to producing economic empowerment for all.\n\n"We should applaud ourselves as we take the journey," she said. "Sometimes we think we should only applaud at the finish line, but the finish line keeps moving. We should applaud as we achieve each success."\n\n-- Maggie Freleng\n	2016-08-25 17:40:13.381194	\N	f	t	1	http://3q3ysyz2dxk4cvtnhs2033mr.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/files/2015/01/1.5.Dorothy-Davis.jpg

194	Paulina Kellogg Wright 	Davis	1813	1876	https://www.womenofthehall.org/	194	The work of Paulina Kellogg Wright Davis as a women’s rights advocate, social reformer, educator, and author extended over forty years from the late 1830s to her death in 1876. Mrs. Wright began her work for women’s rights, anti-slavery and temperance causes when she was only twenty and newly married to Francis Wright, a wealthy merchant from Utica, NY.\nIn the late 1830s, she met Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Ernestine Rose, with whom she joined in a petition to the New York legislature that eventually led to the passage of the Married Women’s Property Act in 1848 that gave married women control of their own personal property and real estate.\nFollowing the death of Francis Wright in 1845, Paulina Wright was left an independent and wealthy woman. She invested her time in studying the anatomy and physiology of women and then conducted a lecture series on female physiology and anatomy, unprecedented in her time, which is said to have encouraged some of her listeners to join the first generation of women physicians.\nIn 1849 she married Thomas Davis, a Rhode Island Congressman and went with him to Washington. In 1850, she was an organizer and then served as president of the First National Women’s Rights Convention in Worcester, MA, which drew participants from nine states. She repeated this the next year at the Second National Women’s Rights Convention, again in Worcester.\nFrom 1853 to 1855, she edited and published a distinctively women’s rights newspaper The Una, which expressed broad views of individual freedom. Post-Civil War, she helped found the New England Woman Suffrage Association. In 1871, she published A History of the National Woman’s Rights Movement.\nWhen a split occurred in the women’s rights movement, she supported the National Woman Suffrage Association with Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton. At her funeral, Mrs. Stanton and Ms. Anthony eulogized Davis and urged others to follow her lifelong example of service to women.\n	2016-08-25 17:40:13.453764	\N	f	t	1	https://www.womenofthehall.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/paulina-kellogg-wright-davis-150x150.jpg	
195	Doris	Day			http://www.dorisday.com/about	195	Doris Day, the quintessential all-American girl, continues to be revered by her fans, while the media still celebrate her as an actress and singer with a legendary Hollywood "girl next door" image. However, Doris Day's personal life, faced with steely resolve, was the very antithesis of how most fans perceived her super-stardom.  The studios promoted her in screen roles highlighting her wholesome, vivacious blonde personality. However, in hindsight, this concentration on her image belied her great acting and musical talents; a full retrospective appraisal of her career in recent years has brought her fans a fuller appreciation of her gifts.  Of her 39 films, Calamity Jane, Love Me or Leave Me and Pillow Talk remain popular favorites, and still run frequently on cable television.  Paralleling her success in big-screen entertainment, a series of excellent albums recorded between 1956 and 1968 expanded her popularity, and are as relevant today as when they were first released. After retirement from the Hollywood spotlight, she moved forward in her second career with the same enthusiasm and energy that put her at the top of the entertainment profession. This time her focus would be on her true passion, the welfare of animals. She worked tirelessly, rescuing, healing and placing literally thousands of abused or neglected animals. When she joined the grassroots organization "Actors and Others for Animals" in the ‘70s, she literally went door to door to rescue pets in distress. She then started her own organization, the Doris Day Animal League, and later the Doris Day Animal Foundation.  The League became a lobbying group on behalf of animal rights, and is now a part of the Humane Society of the United States.\n	2016-08-25 17:40:13.483311	\N	f	t	1	http://www.doctormacro.com/Images/Day,%20Doris/Annex/Annex%20-%20Day,%20Doris%20(It's%20a%20Great%20Feeling)_06.jpg	http://www.biography.com/people/doris-day-9268553/videos/doris-day-mini-biography-42155996

204	Barbara	Deming	1917	1984	http://demingfund.org/index.php	204	Barbara Deming was one of the most dearly loved and respected civil rights and feminist political activists and essayists of our time. Born in New York City in 1917 and educated in The Friends Meeting House Quaker School in N. Y., she went on to study literature and drama at Bennington College and earned a Master’s degree in Drama at Case Western Reserve University in 1941.\n\nDeming began her career as a poet, professional writer and film critic. After becoming interested in Gandhi during a trip to India in 1959, she went on to become a leading thinker in the non-violence movement, arguing for a strictly secular approach to non-violent resistance, with no religious basis. During the Second Wave of feminism, she became a leading thinker and activist with a deep commitment to fighting for the rights of women and the betterment of their lives.\n\nIn the 1960’s, Deming joined demonstrations against Polaris submarines, walked on the San Francisco to Moscow walk for peace in 1962, and attended the International Peace Brigade in Europe. Protesting atomic bomb testing at the Atomic Energy Commission led to her first experience with jail, at the Women’s House of Detention in New York City. She marched in the Nashville to DC bi-racial walk for peace, and in 1963, joined black activists in Birmingham, Alabama and Georgia, as well as attending the House Un-American Activities Committee hearings. In 1964 she joined the 2800-mile Quebec-Guantanamo walk for peace and freedom, a racially integrated protest over US actions in Cuba. During a portion of this march in Albany, Georgia, she was jailed and recorded much of her experience in her book, Prison Notes.\n\nIn 1965-1967 Deming traveled to North and South Vietnam to protest the war.\n\nShe went on to march for feminist and gay rights causes and in 1984, in spite of failing health, once again was jailed on a march through Seneca Falls, organized by the Women’s Peace Encampment, to protest the deployment of Cruise Missiles to Europe.\n\nDeming experienced her first lesbian relationship when she was 17. From 1954-1972, she partnered with Mary Meigs, and later, the Quebecois writer Marie Claire Blais, and from 1976 until her death in 1984, Deming lived with her partner, artist Jane Verlaine in the Florida Keys.\n\nIn 1975, with a passionate commitment to the emerging work of feminist writers, she founded The Money for Women Fund with a few thousand dollars she was able to put aside from her monthly income. In 1977, she wrote in a letter: “Our capital is still very small. . . only about $18,000, which I received from an insurance company after I was hurt in an auto accident. But I also add to the Fund’s account as much money as I am able to save—several thousand dollars each year.”\n\nAt every turn, she wrote about how important it was for women to support the art of other women. After her death in 1984, Money for Women, one of the major beneficiaries of her estate was renamed Money for Women/Barbara Deming Memorial Fund. Without Barbara Deming’s generosity and commitment to supporting the work of feminist artists with every dollar she could spare, The Fund would not exist.

208	Emma Smith	DeVoe	1848	1927	https://www.womenofthehall.org/	208	Emma Smith DeVoe was a leading suffragist in the early twentieth century, not only successfully ran the campaign that enfranchised women in the State of Washington ten years before the national amendment was ratified, but also helped transform the face of politics in America.\nWhile DeVoe supported woman’s suffrage from her early childhood, her real impact came after she moved with her husband to Tacoma, Washington in 1905. She revitalized the near-defunct Washington Equal Suffrage Association and headed up the campaign that resulted in the approval, by a nearly 64 percent majority vote, of a constitutional amendment enfranchising Washington State women. A ladylike, polite, and tactful woman, DeVoe pioneered what she called the Washington plan of campaign. She advocated using “womanly” ways and one-on-one persuasion. She urged her fellow workers to see that women asked every voter in the state to support the suffrage amendment. Thus, DeVoe coupled the precinct method, introduced in Idaho’s 1896 campaign, with her new idea of a statewide canvass to determine how every voter stood on the question of suffrage. She also used other mass techniques, such as penny postcards and posters. She avoided alienating potent forces, such as big business and the brewers, by urging supporters like labor and temperance organizations to support the movement quietly rather than aggressively. She told her workers to remain “good-natured and cheerful.” And to prove that suffragists did not want to change women’s traditional role as homemakers, she published a cookbook that she distributed throughout the state, the back of which had the words “Votes for Women.”\nAfter her victory in Washington, DeVoe campaigned in other states, advocating the Washington method rather than the more aggressive style of eastern suffragists who tended to imitate their British sisters with sit-ins and mass rallies. In addition, she organized the first national organization of voting women, the National Council of Women Voters, which studied issues to educate voters on a non-partisan basis. The organization’s “Declaration of Principles” proclaimed a dedication to holding itself above partisan politics and sectarian affiliations and instead working for equality of opportunity for all, the protection of children, and the promotion of the family.

There her stubborn resistance to conversion during a religious revival marked her as one who did not fear to tread a lonely path.\nDickinson returned from Mount Holyoke to her father’s house and remained there for the rest of her life. Busy about the house and garden, she began to write verse. The narrow boundaries of “woman’s sphere” were deadly limitations for many women. Somehow Dickinson found within herself the imaginative resources to exceed and shatter such boundaries. Although untaught and virtually unpublished during her lifetime, she became one of the greatest poets in the English language.\nSometimes Dickinson sought encouragement and friendship — from author and reformer Thomas Wentworth Higginson among others. But more and more she withdrew. Alone with her thoughts and her pen, she crafted poetry in experimental form that anticipated modern style. She knew what she had achieved: “I have a horror of death; the dead are so soon forgotten. But when I die, they’ll have to remember me.” Nearly 1800 poems were discovered  by her family after her death.\n\n	2016-08-25 17:40:13.748123	\N	f	t	1	https://www.womenofthehall.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/emily-dickinson.jpg	
210	Tjut Njak 	Dien	1848	1908	wisemuslimwomen.org	210	Tjut Njak Dien played an integral role in Indonesian resistance to Dutch imperial forces in the late 19th and early 20th century. When the Dutch invaded Aceh, a northern province in Indonesia, Dien followed her father and husband and re-emerged ten years later as a guerilla commander. Pretending to surrender to Dutch army forces, Dien and her husband joined a Dutch army unit; eventually the two were able to replace as many of the Dutchmen in their unit as they could with Acehnese fighters from their old guerilla units. Observing and learning some of the Dutch’s military strategy, Dien and her husband set up the Dutch army for an “attack” on the Acehnese, for which of course the Acehnese were prepared.\nDien continued to lead Acehnese warriors, battle after battle. Many years after her first husband passed away, Dien married another warrior and gave birth to a girl. After the death of her second husband and daughter, Dien continued to fight against the Dutch until she was taken as a political prisoner in the early 1900s. Dien was banished to Sumendang, a town in West Java, Indonesia. As the only female political prisoner, she became well respected as a scholar of the Qur’an and when she passed in 1908 she was known as Ibu Perbu, Queen of Jihad. In 1964 President Sukarno of Indonesia declared Tjut Njak Dien a national heroine. Today, many Acehnese people visit her tomb in Sumendang.\n	2016-08-25 17:40:13.759471	\N	f	t	1	http://1.bp.blogspot.com/--hgVpqVPf9o/Tn28tFLRflI/AAAAAAAAByw/8o5cdqQXynI/s1600/Cut-Nyak-Dhien-_-duniabebaz.com.jpg	
211	Diane	Dillon-Ridgley			www.womensenews.org	211	Dianne Dillon-Ridgley: Iowa's Ceaseless Traveler for Mother Earth\n\nWherever Dianne Dillon-Ridgley goes, and that is almost anywhere in the world, she acts and reacts to her core belief: Women's rights and the work of developing a sustainable planet are intrinsically linked.\n\n\nThroughout her travels and her many leadership roles, she carries a favorite saying of her grandmother who from her earliest days as a child would extol: "You owe for the time you take up and the space you occupy on the planet."\n\nUnderstanding "all issues are women's issues," Dillon-Ridgley has donned hats representing many issues: she is executive director of the Women's Network for a Sustainable Future, having just completed her term as the first woman to chair the board at the Center for International Environmental Law; she was appointed by the White House to the U.S. delegation for the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio, the 1997 U.N.'s General Assembly on the results of Rio and the 2002 World Summit on Sustainable Development in South Africa, making her the only person to serve on all three delegations. She also served as U.N. representative for the World YWCA-Geneva, and has had an 18-year tenure as director at Interface, Inc., Atlanta, the world's largest manufacturer of commercial carpet tiles and a global leader in sustainable design.\n\nHer decades of work and leadership on climate change, reproductive freedom, human rights and corporate sustainability are all grounded by her fundamental belief that "we must work for a just and sustainable world . . . .and we can never have that world without the full equal participation of women," she said.\n\nGrowing up in Dallas and Kansas City in an African American family of educators, physicians and activists, she learned at an early age the importance of being an advocate for the community, particularly for decisions that impact a community's health and social well-being. When she took her first job as a college intern at the brand new fledgling Environmental Protection Agency, she started a career-long journey where she put that legacy and early knowledge into practice.\n\nDillon-Ridgley said there never was a shift in what she wanted to do. "I just do what I was reared to do."\n\nHer advocacy ranges from promoting more women and people of color on corporate boards to ending female genital mutilation and expanding renewable energy generation. "They are all connected, all essential," she said.\n\nTo note how far we have come in the last half century, Dillon-Ridgley recalled an occasion in the 1980s during her four terms as president of the Association of Iowa Human Rights Agencies, when after a speech she was ineloquently asked: "Are you a woman or 'a black'?" She replied: "I don't divide myself, nor do I allow anyone else to. When I come in the room, all of me crosses the threshold, a woman, mother, daughter, environmentalist, African American, former dancer . . . They are all connected, all essential."\n\n--By Maggie Freleng \n	2016-08-25 17:40:13.775298	\N	f	t	1	http://3q3ysyz2dxk4cvtnhs2033mr.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/files/2015/01/1.6.Dianne-Dillon-Ridgley.jpg	
213	Dorothea	Dix	1802	1887	https://www.womenofthehall.org/	213	An unhappy childhood helped Dorothea Dix to identify with society’s outcasts. Like many young women of her day, she became a school teacher. Surrounded by the ferment of reform in pre-Civil War Boston but untouched by it, she was drifting towards a life of spinsterly aimlessness until one cold day in March 1841. She had volunteered to teach a Sunday school class at the jail in East Cambridge. Among the convicts, shivering in an unheated room, she found some women who were mentally ill. Why was there no stove to warm them, she demanded? Lunatics, she was told, could not feel the cold, and they would only burn themselves or set the building afire. Dorothea Dix determined to act; she had found her cause.\nShe spent over a year touring every jail, almshouse, and house of correction in Massachusetts. She then presented a report, or “memorial” to the Legislature asking for funds for an institution specially designed to treat the mentally ill. She did the same in state after state, traveling thousands of miles alone and publicizing the terrible conditions she found. Always observing the rules of feminine propriety, she rarely spoke publicly, but she was a persuasive lobbyist behind the scenes.\nWhen the Civil War broke out she was appointed superintendent of nurses for the Union Army. Unfortunately, this was a role for which she was ill-suited, and controversy swirled around her. After the war she toured hospitals in the South and in Europe, slowing up but never abandoning her role as crusader for humane treatment of the insane.\n\n	2016-08-25 17:40:13.799961	\N	f	t	1	https://www.womenofthehall.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/dorothea-dix-150x150.jpg

She held two Cabinet positions — Secretary of Transportation under President Reagan (the first woman ever to hold that position) and Secretary of Labor for President George H.W. Bush. In 2002, she won 54% of the vote to become U.S. Senator from North Carolina.\nDole served as President of the American Red Cross– the first woman to hold that position since the organization’s founder, Clara Barton, held it in 1881. As Secretary of Transportation, Dole increased automobile safety requirements and spearheaded the campaign to raise the drinking age to 21. She imposed tougher aviation security measures at airports, and worked to increase the use of passive restraints in vehicles.\nAs Secretary of Labor, Dole initiated the “Glass Ceiling Study” to identify barriers to senior management opportunities for women and minorities and make recommendations for effective change. 62% of her senior staff at Labor were women or minorities. Of this work Dole said, “My objective as Secretary of Labor is to look through the ‘glass ceiling’ to see who is on the other side, and to serve as a catalyst for change.”\nDole also advocated increased support to disadvantaged and unskilled young people to help find employment for at-risk youth. As president of the American Red Cross, Dole directed the work of nearly 30,000 staff members and more than a million volunteers. She overhauled the disaster relief program, turning a $30 million deficit to an on-hand fund of $100 million. She implemented a multi-million dollar program to retool the blood collection, processing and distribution system, which is responsible for one-half of the nation’s blood supply.\nElizabeth Dole has received numerous awards in recognition of her outstanding service, from honorary doctoral degrees to Churchwoman of the Year honors and the Raoul Wallenberg Award for Humanitarian Service.In 2012, she established the Elizabeth Dole Foundation whose purpose is to assist caregivers of “wounded warriors.”\n	2016-08-25 17:40:13.816301	\N	f	t	1	https://www.womenofthehall.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/elizabeth-hanford-dole-150x150.jpg

Huerta has received numerous awards for her community service and advocacy for workers, immigrants, and women's rights. some these rewards would include the Eugene V. Debs Foundation Outstanding American Award, the United States Presidential Eleanor Roosevelt Award for Human Rights and the Presidential Medal of Freedom. In 1960, Huerta co-founded the Agricultural Workers Association which set up voter registration drives and pressed local governments for barrio improvements. In 1962, she co-founded the National Farm Workers Association with César Chávez, which would later become the United Agricultural Workers Organizing Committee. In 1966, she negotiated a contract between the UFWOC and Schenley Wine Company, marking it for the first time that farm workers were able to effectively bargain with an agricultural enterprise. Huerta also championed for the women rights and empowerment in feminist campaigns during her time off union work. She is a big supporter for ethnic diversity in her campaigns.	2016-08-25 17:40:13.835598	\N	f	t	1	https://www.google.com/imgres?imgurl=https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1645761146/official_dh_400x400.jpg&imgrefurl=https://twitter.com/doloreshuerta&h=400&w=400&tbnid=CClIk-qP07h4jM:&tbnh=186&tbnw=186&docid=UPQmLmRu6Nv7bM&itg=1&usg=__m8LzzK0Dt2YEeUNDIR4OFt-hfHk=#h=400&imgdii=CClIk-qP07h4jM%3A%3BCClIk-qP07h4jM%3A%3BJYSSxGXjtihliM%3A&tbnh=186&tbnw=186&w=400	http://www.ovguide.com/dolores-huerta-9202a8c04000641f800000000072f409
216	Majory Stoneman 	Douglas	1890	1998	https://www.womenofthehall.org/	216	Marjory Stoneman Douglas’s 1947 best seller, The Everglades: River of Grass, raised America’s consciousness and transformed the Florida Everglades from an area that was looked upon as a useless swamp – to be drained and developed commercially – to a national park that is seen as a valuable environmental resource to be protected and preserved. After this successful campaign to preserve the Everglades as a national park, Majority Stoneman Douglas  continued her work by founding the Friends of the Everglades, a conservation organization still active today.\nAlways ahead of her time, Douglas graduated from Wellesley College as an English major in 1912. A few years later, Douglas went to Miami to be a reporter for her father’s newspaper, which later became The Miami Herald. During World War I, she served with the American Red Cross in Europe. After the war, she launched her career as a newspaper editor at her father’s paper. Many of her editorials focused on what she perceived to be Florida’s increasing problem of rapid commercial development. In the 1920s, she left the newspaper to launch a second career as an author. Over the years she published many books and short stories, both fiction and non-fiction – most for adults but several for children – especially focusing on women, the history and life in southern Florida and environmental issues. She also engaged in a number of other campaigns and charity work to improve society: campaigns against slum-lords and for improved housing conditions, for free milk for babies whose parents needed aid, and for the ratification of the Women’s Suffrage Amendment.\nMost important, she dedicated her life to preserving and restoring the Everglades. She lived long enough to witness great successes. In 1996, for example, Florida voters passed a constitutional amendment that held polluters primarily responsible for cleaning up the Everglades. And the Florida and federal governments have authorized multimillion-dollar projects to restore and expand the Everglades. In recognition of her tireless and successful struggle, the state of Florida named the headquarters of its Department of Natural Resources after her.\nAwarding Mrs. Douglas the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1993, President Clinton recognized her achievements. Upon her death in 1998 at the age of 108, President Clinton said: “Long before there was an Earth Day, Mrs. Douglas was a passionate steward of our nation’s natural resources, and particularly her Florida Everglades.”\n	2016-08-25 17:40:13.846243	\N	f	t	1	https://www.womenofthehall.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/marjory-stoneman-douglas-205x240.jpg	
217	St. Katharine	Drexel	1858	1955	https://www.womenofthehall.org/	217	A missionary who dedicated her life and fortune to aid Native Americans and African Americans, Saint Katharine Drexel is only the second recognized\nAmerican-born saint.\nSaint Drexel was born into a prominent family in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in 1858.  Her mother died shortly after her birth, and her father remarried two years later, providing Drexel with a new mother.  Drexel and her sisters were raised in a loving family atmosphere permeated by deep faith, and were taught that wealth was meant to be shared with those in need.\nWhen Drexel was growing up, her family would open their home to serve the needs of the poor three days a week, and when Drexel was old enough, she learned to assist her mother.  Later, when the family purchased a summer home in Torresdale, Pennsylvania, Drexel began teaching Sunday school classes.  It was there that she met Reverend James O’Connor, later the Bishop of Omaha, who became her spiritual director.\nWhen Drrexel was in her twenties, her mother was diagnosed with cancer and passed away.  Shortly thereafter in 1885, her father died suddenly, and Drexel and her sisters inherited the income from his estate.  Throughout 1887 and 1888, Drexel was introduced to the plight of Native Americans and visited several remote reservations with Monsignor Joseph Stephan and Bishop O’Connor.  After witnessing the poverty endured by Native Americans, Dreel began building schools and providing food, clothing and financial support to the reservations.\nIn 1889, Bishop O’Connor urged Drexel to found a congregation to work with Native Americans and African Americans.  Although she initially hesitated, through prayer, Drexel eventually accepted this as her vocation and pronounced her vows as the first Sister of the Blessed Sacrament (1891).  During her lifetime, Drexel and her order founded more than sixty missions and schools, including Xavier University of Louisiana.  Today, the Sisters of the Blessed Sacrament remains a religious order devoted to the education and care of Native Americans and African Americans.\nSaint Katharine was beatified in 1988, and canonized by Pope John Paul II on October 1, 2000.\n\n	2016-08-25 17:40:13.868862	\N	f	t	1	https://www.womenofthehall.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/st-katharine-drexel-150x150.jpg

218	Anne	Dudley	1876	1955	https://www.womenofthehall.org/	218	In the final years of the struggle to pass the 19th Amendment to the Constitution giving women the right to vote, Anne Dudley was central to both the national campaign (serving as National Director) and the critical struggle in her home state of Tennessee, which was to become the 36th and final state to support women’s suffrage, thus making the Amendment the law of the land.\nDudley, a woman of elegance and high social standing, ignored the natural constraints of her position to speak out with great force and persuasion on behalf of suffrage. She viewed women’s voting as “a matter of simple justice,” and became the founder and first president of the Nashville Equal Suffrage League, and president of the Tennessee Equal Suffrage Association.\nIn 1917 she was chosen Vice President of the National American Women’s Suffrage Association, working closely with President Carrie Chapman Catt in planning the master strategies of the campaign that finally succeeded in 1920. Dudley became a vigorous and outspoken campaigner throughout the South, matching her speeches with articles for publication and work introducing legislation.\nDudley became the first woman in Tennessee to make an open-air speech, given after she led a march of 2,000 women from downtown Nashville to Centennial Park — the first suffrage parade in the South, in May 1914. She was also the first female associate of the Tennessee Democratic Committee, and the first female delegate-at-large of the National Democratic Convention in 1920.\nThroughout her life and political career, Dudley lived and modeled her conviction regarding women and the rights they were due: “This is a government of, by and for the people, and only the law denies that women are people!”\n\n	2016-08-25 17:40:13.886225	\N	f	t	1	https://www.womenofthehall.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/anne-dallas-dudley-150x150.jpg

As such, she and her husband settled in Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1635. However, as a follower of the dissenter Anne Hutchinson, she and her family were banished by Puritan rulers after Hutchinson was convicted and banished for preaching heretical ideas.\n\nDyer eventually returned to England where she became a protégé of George Fox, the founder of Quakerism. Returning to Boston as a Quaker, she was expelled for preaching Quakerism. Refusing to accept her exile, she returned again and again.\n\nFinally, the rulers of the Massachusetts Bay Colony tried and convicted her of preaching heresy and condemned her to death. Reprieved and expelled, she returned again. Again, she was tried and convicted of violating the statute against preaching Quakerism. This time her sentence was carried out–she was hanged June 1,1660.\n\nWhen offered her life if she would leave Massachusetts and return no more she said: “Nay, I cannot; for in obedience to the will of the Lord God I came, and in His will I abide faithful to death.”\n\nGradually, many came to consider her death the death of a martyr. Some claim that she was ahead of her time, searching for a religion that held women to be equal to men. Her hanging hastened the easing of anti-Quaker statutes and began a process that contributed to the move for more religious tolerance in the colonies and would, ultimately, result in freedom of religion and the separation of church and state in the United States of America.	2016-08-25 17:40:13.955125	\N	f	t	1	https://www.womenofthehall.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/mary-barret-dyer-205x250.jpg

224	Amelia	Earhart	1897		https://www.womenofthehall.org/	224	Amelia Earhart was a vigorous tomboy in her Kansas girlhood. Yet unlike generation after generation of American women, Amelia Earhart did not have to give up action and daring in adulthood. She worked as a volunteer in a Red Cross Hospital during World War I, studied briefly as a premed student, and taught English to immigrant factory workers. But her first love was the airplane, then captivating the public imagination. Surrounded by the excitement of stunt fliers and air shows, she made her first solo flight in 1921 and scraped together the money to buy her own plane.\nIn 1928, when Amelia Earhart was working in a settlement house in Boston, she was approached by the organizers of a transatlantic flight. The woman originally scheduled to be part of the team could not go, so would Amelia take her place? “How could I refuse such a shining adventure!” As the first woman to fly the Atlantic, she won the public’s affection. The press dubbed her “Lady Lindy,” a female Charles Lindbergh.\nShe became aviation editor of Cosmopolitan, was active in Zonta International, and helped establish an organization of women pilots. In 1931 she married George Palmer Putnam, of the publishing family, and his promotional skills kept her name in the press.\nAfter achieving a number of flight “firsts,” she determined to do “just one more long flight,” In 1937 she took off from Miami heading east on an around-the-world course. Her Lockheed Electra was specially equipped, and she was accompanied by a navigator, Fred Noonan. On July 2 they took off for the most difficult leg of the trip, from New Guinea to tiny Howland Island is the mid-Pacific. They never arrived, and an extensive air and sea search failed to turn up any trace of them.\n	2016-08-25 17:40:13.985547	\N	f	t	1	https://www.womenofthehall.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/amelia-earhart-150x150.jpg	
225	Sylvia	Earle	1935		https://www.womenofthehall.org/	225	Sylvia Earle, oceanographer, conservationist, and entrepreneur, has overcome the resistance of both the scientific and general communities to women traveling with men on long scientific expeditions, to become internationally recognized as one of our nation’s leading marine biologists and one of the world’s leading advocates for safeguarding the seas – the earth’s largest and most vital natural resource.\nDr. Earle’s adventures and her sense of wonder and excitement about the living underwater world has opened our eyes to the magnitude of our ignorance about the ocean and inspired us to protect it and respect its role in our lives. Earle has led over 100 expeditions worldwide, involving in excess of 7,000 hours underwater in connection with her research. In 1970, after being rejected from participating in Tektite I because she was a woman, she led the first team of women aquanauts, known as the Tektite II Project, on a two-week exploration of the ocean floor. In 1979, she walked un-tethered on the sea floor at a depth lower than any other person before or since (1,250 feet).\nDetermined to inform the world of her discoveries and the importance of ocean conservation, Earle has authored more than 190 publications on marine science and technology and participated in numerous television productions and lectures in more than eighty countries. Her 1995 book, Sea Change: A Message of the Oceans, has been described as a Rachel Carson-like plea for the preservation of the oceans.\nSometimes referred to as “Her Deepness,” Dr. Earle served for two years as the first female chief scientist of the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration.

226	Catherine	East	1916	1996	https://www.womenofthehall.org/	226	The woman Betty Friedan described as “the midwife to the contemporary women’s movement” spent many years working for the federal government, and it was from this position that much of East’s invaluable data and strategic thinking came to the fore to help women progress in society.\nA staff member on the Kennedy Commission on the Status of Women,  Catherine East saw the range and degree of discrimination women faced nationwide, and she became a feminist, working to help end gender discrimination. She encouraged the creation of state-level commissions on women, in order to collect information and generate activism at that level. While continuing to serve various government bodies working on women’s issues, East also saw the need for the creation of a powerful national women’s organization to spearhead the drive to end gender discrimination and helped found the National Organization for Women (NOW).\nNOW was central to the signing of the federal anti-discrimination legislation. Catherine East was also the architect of the strategy to bring the Equal Rights Amendment out of committee and to passage in House of Representatives.\n	2016-08-25 17:40:14.025795	\N	f	t	1	https://www.womenofthehall.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/catherine-east-150x150.jpg	
227	Crystal	Eastman	1881	1928	https://www.womenofthehall.org/	227	Crystal Eastman, co-founder of the American Civil Liberties Union, struggled throughout her life for equal rights and civil liberties for all. Acquiring her law degree from New York University in 1907, Eastman was one of only a few hundred women lawyers in the early twentieth century. Her first job as an attorney was to investigate labor conditions for the Russell Sage Foundation. Her pioneering report, Work Accidents and the Law (1910), led New York Governor Charles Evans Hughes to appoint her the first woman on New York State’s Commission on Employers’ Liability and Causes of Industrial Accidents, Unemployment and Lack of Farm Labor. As a member of that commission, Eastman drafted the country’s first workers’ compensation law. That legislation became the model for workers’ compensation throughout the nation. Then, during Woodrow Wilson’s administration, Eastman became investigating attorney for the United States Commission on Industrial Relations.\nMeanwhile, Eastman also struggled to further women’s rights – first suffrage and later equal rights – as co-author of the first Equal Rights Amendment. During World War I, she was a leader of the peace movement, working with Carrie Chapman Catt to organize the Carnegie Hall meeting that led to the founding of the Woman’s Peace Party of New York -later renamed the Women’s International League of Peace and Freedom – the oldest women’s peace organization. Eastman became Executive Secretary of the Women’s Peace Party. A leading advocate for civil liberties and the rights of conscientious objectors during World War I, she joined Norman Thomas and Roger Baldwin in founding the American Civil Liberties Union as the “watch dog” organization protecting Americans’ rights under the Bill of Rights and providing legal assistance to those whose rights may have been violated, regardless of partisan persuasion.\nA brilliant orator and effective writer, Eastman campaigned throughout her life for peace, equal rights, and civil liberties. In a eulogy written for The Nation, Freda Kirchney remembered Eastman’s sincerity and enthusiasm. “When she spoke to people – whether it was to a small committee or a swarming crowd – hearts beat faster . . . . She was for thousands a symbol of what the free woman might be.”\n\n	2016-08-25 17:40:14.039497	\N	f	t	1	https://www.womenofthehall.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/crystal-eastman-150x150.jpg

229	Mary Baker 	Eddy	1821	1910	https://www.womenofthehall.org/	229	Mary Baker Eddy overcame years of ill health and great personal struggle to make an indelible mark on society, religion and journalism.\nHer life has been described as a continual struggle for health amid tumultuous relationships. Ill health in childhood spent in New Hampshire meant a limited home education, and the death of her first husband left her penniless and pregnant. With family help and a deep religious faith, she recovered over a period of years, but her son was raised throughout his life by others. She remarried ten years after her widowhood, an unsuccessful union that further aggravated her fragile health. She then met Dr. Phineas Quimby, a healer, who helped her regain her full strength. It was with Quimby’s tutelage that Eddy began to believe that the cause and cure of disease was mental. Later, after Quimby’s death, she fell on the ice, causing great injury. After several days, Eddy pronounced herself healed, after reading from the Bible. This led to years of reflection, study and false starts, but in 1875 she opened a “Christian Scientists’ Home” in Lynn, Massachusetts, and soon began holding public services. She then helped found the Christian Science Publishing Society and published the first edition of Science and Health, a 456-page book of her beliefs. In 1877 she married for the third time, and in 1879, the First Church of Christ, Scientist was formally chartered. In 1881 she also obtained a charter for the Massachusetts Metaphysical College as a degree-granting institution — and all of this moved to Boston in 1881. Eddy proved effective at teaching hundreds of students, most of them women, to go out across the nation as Christian Science practitioners, organizing societies and recruiting still more practitioners as they went.\nIn 1883 Eddy founded the monthly Christian Science Journal and later the Christian Science Sentinel. Her seminal work, Science and Health, continued to grow and be reprinted. In 1908, just two years before her death at 89, Eddy started a newspaper dedicated to public service, The Christian Science Monitor, because she felt that the “yellow journalism” of the American press was unfairly prejudicial against her faith. In her work No and Yes, printed in 1909, Eddy wrote, “True prayer is not asking God for love; it is learning to love, and to include all mankind in one affection.”\n\n	2016-08-25 17:40:14.146028	\N	f	t	1	https://www.womenofthehall.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/mary-baker-eddy-150x150.jpg	
230	Marian Wright 	Edelman	1939		http://www.childrensdefense.org/	230	Marian Wright Edelman is an American lawyer and activist for the rights of children. She has been an advocate for disadvantaged Americans for her entire professional life. She is president and founder of the Children's Defense Fund. Edelman was the first African American woman admitted to The Mississippi Bar. She began practicing law with the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund's Mississippi office, working on racial justice issues connected with the civil rights movement and representing activists during the Mississippi Freedom Summer of 1964. She also helped establish a Head Start program.\nEdelman continued her work and contributed to the organizing of the Poor People's Campaign of Martin Luther King Jr. and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference. She founded the Washington Research Project, a public interest law firm and also became interested in issues related to childhood development and children.\nIn 1973, she founded the Children's Defense Fund as a voice for poor children, children of color, and children with disabilities. The organization has served as an advocacy and research center for children's issues, documenting the problems and possible solutions to children in need. She also became involved in several school desegregation cases and served on the board of the Child Development Group of Mississippi, which represented one of the largest Head Start programs in the country.\nAs founder, leader and principal spokesperson for the CDF, Mrs. Edelman worked to persuade Congress to overhaul foster care, support adoption, improve child care and protect children who are disabled, homeless, abused or neglected. Her philosophy can be sumarized in her quote, "If you don’t like the way the world is, you have an obligation to change it. Just do it one step at a time."\nEdelman continues to advocate youth pregnancy prevention, child-care funding, prenatal care, greater parental responsibility in teaching values and curtailing what she sees as children’s exposure to the barrage of violent images transmitted by mass media. Edelman serves on the board of the New York City based Robin Hood Foundation, a charitable organization dedicated to the elimination of poverty.\n	2016-08-25 17:40:14.16867	\N	f	t	1	http://thecommunity.com/project/marian-wright-edelman/	http://www.makers.com/marian-wright-edelman
231	Marian Wright 	Edelman	1939		https://www.womenofthehall.org/	231	Marian Wright Edelman, civil rights activist and founder of the Children’s Defense Fund, has dedicated her life to those who cannot always lift themselves up.\nEdelman obtained a law degree at Yale and worked in Mississippi, becoming the first African-American woman to be admitted to that state’s bar. As a leader with the NAACP Legal Defense & Education Fund, Edelman helped coordinate the Poor People’s Campaign after Martin Luther King, Jr.’s assassination. She founded the Children’s Defense Fund in the 1970s, to apply pressure on the federal government to help poor children, and to coordinate nationwide activities to help children. Considered the nation’s most powerful children’s lobby, CDF secured the 1990 Act for Better Child Care, bringing more than $3 billion into daycare facilities and other programs. Many consider this law the first federal government acknowledgment that children matter.\nWith millions of American children living in poverty, Edelman continues her advocacy, focusing on expanding Head Start, health care and support for homeless children. In 1993 Edelman published her book, The Measure of Our Success: A Letter to My Children and Yours. She is the recipient of many awards including the Presidential Medal of Freedom.\n\n	2016-08-25 17:40:14.189464	\N	f	t	1	https://www.womenofthehall.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/marian-wright-edelman-150x150.jpg

The center's two locations, the other also in a neighborhood where many Asians settle down in, offer such innovative programs as trauma-centered yoga, mentoring for child witnesses to family violence and immigration legal services, as well as walk-in assessment, English language tutoring, job counseling, emergency shelter housing and public benefits.\n\nElizaga has served as board chair for the NYAWC since June 2013 and as a board member since 2007. With Elizaga at the helm fundraising, NYAWC has broken annual gala records steadily since 2007 and is particularly proud of the organization's increased attention to protecting victims of human trafficking.\n\nElizaga grew up in Honolulu and has traveled all over the world. She graduated law school at the American University Washington College of Law in 1996. After an unsatisfying career as a lawyer, she decided to change her trajectory.\n\nIn 2004, at the age of 33, she founded Forward Options, a personal and executive coaching firm. Earning a Certificate in Organizational and Executive Coaching from New York University, and authoring the 2014 book "Find Your Sweet Spot," she is passionate about inspiring young women to make the most out of their personal and professional lives.\n\n"My favorite exercise with clients is getting them to think of a person they love, somebody they would do anything for to see them succeed and to try and turn that feeling back around on themselves and embrace a form of self-love," Elizaga said. "Confidence and self-esteem are crucial in achieving success in both the personal and professional life."\n\nShe considers one great success a break through with a female teen who appeared unimpressed and apathetic during a workshop. The teen later sent Elizaga an email, thanking her for opening her eyes and showing her she could aspire to greater things despite her tough home life. Nine years later, the young woman graduated from college, works at a job she loves and she and Elizaga are still in touch.\n\n"It's a work in progress," Elizaga said. "I feel like I'm never finished. There's always more that can and should be done for women who are disenfranchised and in dangerous situations. I want us to go further and continue doing amazing work."\n\n--By Coryn Julien\n	2016-08-25 17:40:14.295174	\N	f	t	1	 http://3q3ysyz2dxk4cvtnhs2033mr.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/files/2015/01/1.7.Karen-Elizaga.jpg

243	Dorothy Harrison 	Eustis	1886	1946	https://www.womenofthehall.org/	243	A philanthropist, Dorothy Harrison Eustis combined her love of animals and her passion for helping others to co-found the nation’s first dog guide school, The Seeing Eye.\nBorn in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in 1886, Eustis was educated at the Agnes Irwin School and later at the Rathgowrie School in England.  In 1906, she married Walter Abbott Wood and moved to New York.  Together, with the state department of agriculture, they operated an experimental dairy farm.  There, they demonstrated that selective breeding could increase the milk production and commercial value of dairy cattle.  That work continued until 1917, two years after Wood’s death.\nIn 1921, Eustis relocated to Switzerland, where she began an experimental breeding kennel for dogs.  She married George Morris Eustis in 1923, and at their estate, Fortunate Fields, they worked to breed and train German shepherds for civic duty.  In 1927, Eustis discovered a school in Potsdam that taught dogs to serve as guides for blind war veterans.  Impressed by the school’s work, Eustis wrote an article entitled The Seeing Eye, which ran in the November 5, 1927 edition of the Saturday Evening Post.\nWhen a young, blind American man named Morris Frank read the article, he was inspired to write to Eustis and request a guide dog.  Eustis agreed to help, bringing Frank to Switzerland and providing him with a dog.  When Frank returned to the United States with his dog, they earned much publicity and received many inquiries from other blind people.  Shortly after, Eustis moved back to the United States.

273	Ina May 	Gaskin	1940		https://www.womenofthehall.org/	273	A certified professional midwife who has attended more than 1,200 births, Ina May Gaskin is known as the “mother of authentic midwifery.”\nGaskin joined the Peace Corps after college and taught English in Malaysia for two years before returning to the United States to obtain her master’s degree.\nDuring the birth of her first child in the 1960’s, Gaskin experienced the terrible practice of having her child pulled into the world with forceps.  The incident fueled her determination to find a saner way to give birth.  A few years later, during a five-month long speaking tour with her husband, Stephen Gaskin, and more than two hundred young idealists, she witnessed her first birth, one of many that would occur during the trip.  Because many of the women were without health insurance or money to pay for a doctor, Gaskin often assisted in births by default, eventually aided by the instruction and support of a sympathetic obstetrician.\nIn 1971, the group purchased a large tract of land in rural Tennessee and established a cooperative community.   Gaskin located a doctor willing to serve as a mentor and medical liaison, and the Farm Midwifery Center was born.\nDuring a stay in Guatemala in 1976, Gaskin learned a technique for preventing and resolving shoulder dystocia, a condition that occurs during birth when the baby’s head is born, but the shoulders are stuck in the birth canal.  After using the method with great success, she began to teach and publish articles about the method.  Now referred to as the Gaskin maneuver, it is the first obstetrical procedure to be named after a midwife.\nGaskin has lectured in numerous countries and is the author of several books, including Spiritual Midwifery (1975), the first text written by a midwife published in the United States.  In 2011, Gaskin received the Right Livelihood Award, an honor bestowed each year by the Swedish Parliament; the award is often referred to as the “Alternative Nobel Prize.”\n\n	2016-08-25 17:40:14.891969	\N	f	t	1	https://www.womenofthehall.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/ina-may-gaskin-150x150.jpg

Ferraro ran successfully for Congress from New York City’s 9th District in 1978. There, she was a women’s and human rights advocate, working for passage of the Equal Rights Amendment, sponsoring the Women’s Economic Equity Act ending pension discrimination against women, and seeking greater job training and opportunities for displaced homemakers.\nIn 1984, Ferraro was picked to run as Vice President of the United States on the Democratic Party ticket with former Vice President Walter Mondale as the candidate for President. In her acceptance speech, she spoke of the realization of the American dream: “Tonight, the daughter of an immigrant from Italy has been chosen to run for vice president in the new land my father came to love…” The ticket lost, but Ferraro’s candidacy forever reshaped the American political and social landscape.\n\n	2016-08-25 17:40:14.495802	\N	f	t	1	https://www.womenofthehall.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/geraldine-ferraro-150x150.gif

252	Ella	Fitzgerald	1917	1996	https://www.womenofthehall.org/	252	The woman who was perhaps the nation’s greatest jazz and pop artist began singing by accident, as legend has it.\nWhen Ella Fitzgerald was fifteen years old, she appeared as a contestant in a talent competition intending to dance. Her knees shook too much, and so she sang instead — and was heard by a musician in the famed Chick Webb Band. Webb brought the young girl along to sing for a one-night stand tryout, and the rest is history.\nBy 1937, only three years after beginning her career, Fitzgerald won her first Down Beat Magazine award for most popular girl vocalist, and in 1938 she had her first major hit, “A-Tisket, A-Tasket.” Dizzy Gillespie introduced her to the world of bop, and she began her lifelong improvising with “Lady Be Good.”\nOf the magic her voice produced, the New York Times drama critic Brooks Atkinson wrote, “She manages things that the human voice can’t do.” Fitzgerald, with “Jazz at the Philharmonic” producer Norman Granz, began touring worldwide in 1948 — and Granz and Fitzgerald demanded equal pay for her with white artists, forcing an important issue that affected many musicians and artists thereafter.\nThroughout her long career, Fitzgerald recorded the music of the Gershwins, Irving Berlin, Johnny Mercer, Ellington, Armstrong, Harold Arlen, Cole Porter and more, singing with the world’s finest musicians, including Benny Goodman, Teddy Wilson and Duke Ellington, to list a few.\nFitzgerald was also an inspiration for her lifetime of good works, receiving the Whitney M. Young, Jr., Award of the Los Angeles Urban League, the first woman to receive it, for those who build bridges among races and generations. She received the National Medal of Arts, and was the first woman and first pop singer to receive the Lincoln Centre Medallion, previously awarded only to internationally-famed classical musicians. Her honorary doctorates and Grammies and other awards are almost numberless — and yet when we think of Ella, what we will always hear is that pure, passionate, endlessly creating voice, and the soul behind it, telling us what she knows about life and love and hope and courage.\n\n	2016-08-25 17:40:14.526455	\N	f	t	1	https://www.womenofthehall.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/ella-fitzgerald-150x150.jpg	
253	Judith	Flores				253	Dr. Judith Flores graduated from the Mount Sinai School of Medicine in 1976 and has built her career working in many ‪New York City communities. Dr. Flores has said that she couldn’t remember wanting anything as much as a career in medicine, stating: “For many of the families where I come from being a ‘Doctora’ was the highest achievable and mostly unattainable goal … I specifically wanted to be a pediatrician even before I could spell it! It combined both working with kids to help them feel better with the challenge and excitement of science.”\n\nHer goal to be of service to her community, Hispanic families in particular, spurred her in the development of an award-winning bilingual, bi-cultural asthma management program which worked with Sunset Park’s Hispanic community to provide a higher level of care to patients and to educate patients and their families about chronic disease management. “The program has improved the quality of life for people with asthma and reduced the severity of asthma attacks … [and] won the C. Everett Koop National Health Award for 1997 and the 2001 Asthma and Allergy Foundation Innovations in Care Award.”\n\nDr. Flores acknowledges that there were racial and political barriers for her as a Puerto Rican woman but credits her mother with helping her to achieve her great ambitions, stating “My mother raised me to have no doubt that I would succeed. In retrospect, this was amazing considering the circumstances.”	2016-08-25 17:40:14.542254	\N	f	t	1	https://scontent-lga3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/12814749_647916235346426_1734858595097805374_n.jpg?oh=2ec5643a60a2ce270335098ab97e1f11&oe=5780BFF3	
254	Betty	Ford	1918	2011	https://www.womenofthehall.org/	254	A groundbreaking First Lady, Betty Ford is often remembered for her candor in addressing the -controversial issues of her time.\nElizabeth Anne “Betty” Bloomer was born in Chicago and raised in Grand Rapids, Michigan.  After graduating from Central High School, she went on to study modern dance at Bennington School of the Dance.  While a student at Bennington, she met renowned choreographer Martha Graham and became a member of her Auxiliary Performance Troupe in New York City.\nBloomer returned to Michigan in 1941 and became a fashion coordinator for a department store.  During this time, she continued to pursue her love of dance by starting her own performance group and teaching dance to handicapped children.\nShortly after her marriage to Gerald Ford, the Fords moved to Washington, DC, where Mr. Ford served as a member of the House of Representatives and Mrs. Ford assumed the duties of a congressional spouse.\nIn 1973, Mr. Ford was appointed Vice President of the United States.  One year later, in a dramatic turn of political events, upon the resignation of President Nixon, Gerald Ford became the 38th President of the United States and Mrs. Ford became the First Lady.  A few months later, Mrs. Ford was diagnosed with breast cancer and underwent a radical mastectomy.  Rather than suppressing the diagnosis, she courageously shared her story and inspired countless women across the nation to get breast examinations.  During her tenure as First Lady, Mrs. Ford continued to be an outspoken advocate of women’s rights, addressing public issues like the Equal Rights Amendment and increasing the number of women appointed to senior government posts.\nThe Fords left politics in 1976 and moved to Rancho Mirage, California.  In 1978, following a family intervention, Mrs. Ford underwent successful treatment for addiction to alcohol and prescription drugs.  She again used her personal story to raise public awareness of addiction, and in 1982, she co-founded the Betty Ford Center to treat victims of alcohol and chemical dependency.\nMrs. Ford was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1991 and the Congressional Gold Medal, with President Gerald R. Ford, in 1999.\n\n	2016-08-25 17:40:14.555509	\N	f	t	1	https://www.womenofthehall.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/betty-ford-150x150.jpg

Ford has transformed the profession of nursing and made health care more accessible to the general public.\nIn the early 1960s, Dr. Ford discovered that, because of a shortage of primary care physicians in the community, health care for children and families was severely lacking.  In 1965, she partnered with Henry K. Silver, a pediatrician at the University of Colorado Medical Center, to create and implement the first pediatric nurse practitioner model and training program.  The program combined clinical care and research to teach nurses to factor in the social, psychological, environmental and economic situations of patients when developing care plans.\nWhen the program became a national success in 1972, Dr. Ford was recruited to serve as the Founding Dean of the University of Rochester School of Nursing.  At the university, Dr. Ford developed and implemented the unification model of nursing.  Through the model, clinical practice, education and research were combined to provide nurses with a more holistic education.\nDr. Ford is the author of more than 100 publications and has served as a consultant and lecturer to multiple organizations and universities.

256	Abby Kelley 	Foster	1811	1887	https://www.womenofthehall.org/	256	During her lifetime, Abby Kelley Foster followed the motto, “Go where least wanted, for there you are most needed.”  A major figure in the national anti-slavery and women’s rights movements, she spent more than twenty years traveling the country as a tireless crusader for social justice and equality for all.\nFoster was born into a Quaker family in Pelham, Massachusetts in 1811, and raised in Worcester, Massachusetts at a time when society demanded that women be silent, submissive and obedient.  After attending boarding school, she held teaching positions in Worcester, Millbury and Lynn, Massachusetts.\nIn Lynn, she joined the Female Anti-Slavery Society, where she became corresponding secretary and later, a national delegate to the first Anti-Slavery Convention of American Women in 1837.  The following year, Foster made her first public speech against slavery, and was so well received that she abandoned her teaching career and returned to Millbury.  There, she founded the Millbury Anti-Slavery Society and began lecturing for the American Anti-Slavery Society.\nDuring the next two decades, Foster served as a lecturer, fundraiser, recruiter and organizer in the fight for abolition and suffrage.  In 1850, she helped develop plans for the National Women’s Rights Convention in Massachusetts.  There, she gave one of her most well-known speeches, in which she challenged women to demand the responsibilities as well as the privileges of equality, noting “Bloody feet, sisters, have worn smooth the path by which you come hither.”\nIn 1854, Foster became the chief fundraiser for the American Anti-Slavery Society, and by 1857, she was its general agent.  Through the American Anti-Slavery Society, Foster continued to work for the ratification of the fourteenth and fifteenth amendments.\nIn her later years, once slavery was abolished and the rights of freedmen were guaranteed, Foster focused her activism primarily on women’s rights.  She held meetings, arranged lectures, and called for ‘severe language’ in any resolutions that were adopted.  In 1868, she was among the organizers of the founding convention of the New England Woman Suffrage Association, the first regional association advocating woman suffrage.  Foster’s efforts were among those that helped lay the groundwork for the nineteenth amendment to the U.S. Constitution.\n\n	2016-08-25 17:40:14.597231	\N	f	t	1	https://www.womenofthehall.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/abby-kelley-foster-150x150.jpg	
257	Helen Murray 	Free	1923		https://www.womenofthehall.org/	257	A pioneering chemist, Helen Murray Free conducted scientific research that revolutionized diagnostic testing in the laboratory and at home.\nFree attended college intending to major in English and Latin.  However, due to the events of Pearl Harbor and subsequent enlistment and drafting of men into the army, women were strongly encouraged to pursue careers in science.  Helen then changed her major to chemistry, receiving her B.S. from the College of Wooster in 1945.\nUpon her graduation, Free immediately began work as a quality control chemist at Miles Laboratories, later acquired by Bayer Diagnostics.  While at Miles, Free served as a researcher, director, and manager.  She also met Alfred Free, a noted biochemist.  They married in 1947.\nTogether, the Frees became life-long scientific partners and changed the face of medical diagnostics.  Some of their early work centered around the improvement of the Clinitest, a tablet that measured glucose levels in the urine of diabetic patients.  They went on to develop the Acetest, another tablet test for diabetes.  Their research culminated in the development of Clinistix, the first dip-and-read diagnostic test strips for monitoring glucose in urine.\nIn 1975, the Frees co-authored their second book, Urinalysis in Laboratory Practice, which is still a standard work in the field.  They also developed additional strips for testing levels of key indicators for other diseases.\nAlthough she retired in 1982, Free continues to be a strong advocate of science education, paying special attention to female and underprivileged students through programs like Kids & Chemistry and Expanding Your Horizons.\nFree holds seven patents and is the recipient of numerous awards including the American Chemical Society’s Garvan Medal (1980), the National Medal of Technology and Innovation (2010), and the American Chemical Society’s 66th National Historic Chemical Landmark designation (2010).\nToday, the availability and low cost of dip-and-read strips make testing for diabetes, pregnancy, and other conditions available in underdeveloped regions of the United States and in foreign countries, saving or extending countless lives.\n\n	2016-08-25 17:40:14.615586	\N	f	t	1	https://www.womenofthehall.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/helen-murray-free-150x150.jpg

267	Matilda Joslyn 	Gage	1826	1898	https://www.womenofthehall.org/	267	Best known in history as the co-author (with Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony) of the first three volumes of The History of Woman Suffrage, Matilda Joslyn Gage (1826-1898) holds a significant position in history as a radical feminist thinker and historian whose writings shaped her times.\nAn excellent speaker and writer, Gage held a variety of offices in the National Woman Suffrage Association and helped form suffrage groups in New York and Virginia. She edited the NWSA suffrage paper, The National Citizen and Ballot Box for four years, and wrote much material for suffrage publications. Gage tried to cast a ballot in the 1872 presidential elections and failed, but she actively supported Anthony during the court case which arose from Anthony’s successful casting of a ballot. She co-authored the Declaration of Rights for Women (1876) with Stanton, which was presented at the Independence Day ceremonies that summer in Philadelphia.\nAfter becoming discouraged with the slow pace of suffrage efforts in the 1880s, Gage turned her attention to the teaching of the churches, which she perceived as teaching men to devalue women. In 1890 she formed her own organization, the Women’s National Liberal Union, to fight moves to unite church and state, and her book Women, Church and State (1893) articulated her views.\nGage remained a suffrage supporter throughout her life, but spent her elder years concentrating on religious issues. Her lifelong motto appears on her gravestone: “There is a word sweeter than Mother, Home or Heaven; that word is Liberty.”\n\n	2016-08-25 17:40:14.80526	\N	f	t	1	https://www.womenofthehall.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/matilda-joslyn-gage-150x150.jpg	
268	Matilda Joslyn 	Gage	1826	1898	http://www.matildajoslyngage.org/	268	"Matilda Joslyn Gage was born on March 24, 1826, in Cicero, New York. An only child, she was raised in a household dedicated to antislavery. Her father, Dr. Hezekiah Joslyn, was a nationally known abolitionist, and the Joslyn home was a station on the Underground Railway. In 1845 she married merchant Henry Hill Gage, with whom she would have four children. They eventually settled in Fayetteville, New York, and their home became a station on the Underground Railroad. Although occupied with both family and antislavery activities, Gage was drawn to a new cause: the woman’s suffrage movement. Her life’s work would become the struggle for the complete liberation of women. Unable to attend the first Woman’s Rights Convention held in Seneca Falls in 1848, Gage attended and addressed the third national convention in Syracuse in 1852. She became a noted speaker and writer on woman’s suffrage. During the Civil War, Gage was an enthusiastic organizer of hospital supplies for Union soldiers. In 1862 she predicted the failure of any course of defense and maintenance of the Union that did not emancipate the slaves.\nGage, along with Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton, was a founding member of the National Woman Suffrage Association and served in various offices of that organization (1869-1889). She helped organize the Virginia and New York state suffrage associations, and was an officer in the New York association for twenty years.  Gage was one of the women who wrote and presented the "Women's Declaration of Rights" at the 1876 Protest at the National Centennial celebration. From 1878 to 1881 she published the National Citizen and Ballot Box, the official newspaper of the NWSA. In 1871 Gage was one of the many women nationwide who unsuccessfully tried to test the law by attempting to vote. When Susan B. Anthony successfully voted in the 1872 presidential election and was arrested, Gage came to her aid and supported her during her trial. In 1880 Gage led 102 Fayetteville women to the polls in 1880 when New York State allowed women to vote in school districts where they paid their taxes.\nDuring the 1870s Gage spoke out against the brutal and unfair treatment of Native Americans. She was adopted into the Wolf Clan of the Mohawk nation and given the name Ka-ron-ien-ha-wi (Sky Carrier). Inspired by the Six Nation Iroquois Confederacy’s form of government, where 'the power between the sexes was nearly equal,' this indigenous practice of woman’s rights became her vision.\nGage coedited with Stanton and Anthony the first three volumes of the six-volume The History of Woman Suffrage (1881-1887). She also authored the influential pamphlets Woman as Inventor (1870), Woman’s Rights Catechism (1871), and Who Planned the Tennessee Campaign of 1862? (1880). Discouraged with the slow pace of suffrage efforts in the 1880s, and alarmed by the conservative religious movement that had as its goal the establishment of a Christian state, Gage formed the Women’s National Liberal Union in 1890, to fight moves to unite church and state. Her book Woman, Church and State (1893) articulates her views. While Gage remained a supporter of woman’s rights throughout her life, she spent her elder years concentrating on religious issues. Gage died in Chicago, Illinois, on March 18, 1898. Her lifelong motto appears on her gravestone in Fayetteville: 'There is a word sweeter than Mother, Home or Heaven; that word is Liberty.'

265	Margaret 	Fuller	1810	1850	www.margaretfuller.wordpress.com	265	Sarah Margaret Fuller was born in Cambridgeport, Massachusetts, the first child of Margarett Crane Fuller and Timothy Fuller.  Desiring a son, her Harvard-educated lawyer/politician father gave her a classical male education. Margaret was pushed to the limits, which produced recurring headaches and nightmares. Her only solace was sitting in her mother’s luscious flower garden.\n\nAt 21 years old, Margaret experienced a spiritual crisis during a Unitarian church service which heralded an epiphany that led her toward the intuitive knowing of the emerging Transcendentalist movement. Her father retired from his four-term political service in the U.S. House of Representatives to become a farmer in Groton, Massachusetts. In 1835, he died unexpectedly of cholera. As “the eldest son,” Margaret was obligated to go out and work for her mother and younger siblings, whom she also taught. She gave up her dream of going on the Grand Tour of Europe.\n\nMargaret met Transcendentalist Ralph Waldo Emerson and taught for A. Bronson Alcott, father of Louisa May Alcott, at his experimental Temple School in Boston. She was invited to be a member of the Transcendental Club, where she was treated by the men as an equal. During 1839, Margaret published her translation of Eckermann’s Conversation with Goethe, became the first editor of the Transcendentalist Dial magazine, and began her first series of “Conversations” for women in Boston. \n\nElizabeth Cady Stanton and Mrs. Horace Greeley attended some of her “Conversations.” Margaret published “The Great Lawsuit: Man vs. Men, Woman vs. Women,” in the Dial in 1843. She traveled with companions through the West, which was the Great Lakes region then, and wrote about this sojourn in her book, “Summer on the Lakes,” researching as the first woman allowed in Harvard library. Horace Greeley, publisher of the New York Tribune, became so enamored of the West Margaret described in her book, coupled with his wife’s insistence, that he hired Margaret as the first woman reporter.\n\nOn her way from Boston to New York City in the fall of 1844, Margaret spent seven weeks in Fishkill Landing, NY, revising “The Great Lawsuit” into the first American feminist book, “Woman in the Nineteenth Century.” Published in 1845 by Greeley, the book became a national and international bestseller. From 1844 to 1846, Margaret wrote social and literary criticism, exposing the corruption in hospitals and prisons while defining and supporting the new American literature. Considered the most brilliant woman in America, she was met only by Edgar Allan Poe as an outstanding literary critic.\n\nHer friends, Rebecca and Marcus Spring, offered Margaret the Grand Tour of Europe in 1846. She negotiated with Greeley to become his first woman foreign correspondent. Margaret travelled through England, Scotland, and France, meeting Italian revolutionary exile, Giuseppe Mazzini, Polish poet exile, Adam Mickiewicz, and her mentor, writer George Sand, and Sand’s lover, pianist Frederic Chopin. She awakened to the people’s unrest and discontent and wrote about their struggles.\n\nDuring Holy Week in St. Peter’s Basilica, Vatican City, Margaret met Count Giovanni Angelo Ossoli, whom she came back to be with in Rome after she became ill on the Grand Tour in 1847. Margaret gave birth to Angelo Eugenio Filippo Ossoli in Rieti, Italy, on September 5, 1848. During the Roman Revolution, she remained the only American in Rome, serving the wounded and dying Roman soldiers as director of the field hospital on the Tiber.  Her husband fought for the people’s Revolution. \n\nCatholic France bombarded Rome while Margaret wrote of the horror as first woman war correspondent. With Rome’s fall, Margaret and Ossoli escaped to Florence where she continued to write her firsthand account of the Roman Revolution. They met Elizabeth Barrett Browning and Robert Browning there. Returning to America to start afresh in New York City’s Italian community, Margaret, Ossoli, and their child, Angelino, perished in a shipwreck during a hurricane off Fire Island, New York on July 19, 1850.

270	Karina	Garcia				270	My favorite activist is Karina Garcia. She is a Mexican-American woman who fights for reproductive rights. She even inspired me to do a research project because a lot of women are looked down upon because they are not ready to have a family. Sometimes they are ready, but the reality of their life causes them not to be able to have a child due to poverty, family conflict, etc. My sister was considering abortion because of the way my family was threatening to disown her and put her in the streets. I'm so happy she decided to keep my niece and I even helped raise her and continue to do so today. Karina opened my eyes to how many different women deal with this and that it is okay. We need to change the mindset of society to end this idea.\n\n	2016-08-25 17:40:14.855297	\N	f	t	1	https://thumbs.famebit.com/b6aee505ee61d3d116f7e8e239084b6687413fb77112a83b56f4b53e56d48507.jpg

1030	Lillian	Wald	1867	1940	http://www.columbia.edu/cu/lweb/archival/collections/ldpd_4079444/	\N	"In 1893 on the Lower East Side of New York City, Lillian Wald, a New York Hospital nursing graduate, was teaching a course to immigrant women on home care and hygiene.  One morning, the daughter of one of Wald’s students came into the classroom in tears, saying that her mother was sick.\r\n\r\nLillian Wald followed the child to her family’s apartment, where she found a woman lying in a dirty bed soaked with blood. The child’s mother had been hemorrhaging since giving birth two days earlier.\r\n\r\nWald ministered to the woman, cleaned the bed and room, and comforted the family. The family was so grateful to Lillian Wald that as she turned to go, they kissed her hands.\r\n\r\nThis event was the impetus behind what has become the Visiting Nurse Service of New York. Within months, Wald and a colleague had established a presence on the Lower East Side, obtaining financial and government support for their mission. By 1895, the settlement had moved to a larger facility on Henry Street.\r\n\r\nBy providing care for their neighbors’ illnesses, and assisting with births and with deaths, Wald and her colleagues became the first public health nurses in the country.  \r\n\r\nThroughout her career, Wald never lost sight of the fact that the health of the community affected the health of the individual. In particular, she sought to improve the lives of women, children, and recent immigrants.\r\n\r\nLillian Wald sought to improve working conditions for women. She was active in founding the Women’s Trade Union League and served on the commission that led to the formation of New York State’s Bureau of Industries. She also worked to abolish child labor and helped to found the Federal Children’s Bureau.\r\n\r\nWald’s commitment to improving children’s lives extended to expanding their educational and recreational opportunities as well. The Henry Street Settlement was home to the largest playground on the Lower East Side. Wald also pressured the New York City board of education to offer educational opportunities for children with physical and learning disabilities, to hire nurses for the schools, and to establish school lunch programs for all children.\r\n\r\nAlthough the Henry Street Settlement was the first and best known, branches were opened throughout Manhattan and the Bronx to provide health care, community programs, and employment to New Yorkers regardless of race or ethnicity. Wald made the Henry Street Settlement available as the meeting place for the National Negro Conference, which became the NAACP.\r\n\r\nUpon her death at age 73 in 1940, thousands filled Carnegie Hall to celebrate Wald’s remarkable legacy and to hear messages from leaders including President Roosevelt commending Lillian Wald’s vision, compassion, and leadership."  -Visiting Nurse Service of NY website  	2016-08-26 20:05:31.236501	\N	f	f	1	https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/21/Portrait_of_Lillian_Wald.jpg	\N
277	 Althea	Gibson	1927	2003		277	Althea Gibson was born in South Carolina and raised in Harlem. Her family struggled to make ends meet, living on public assistance for a time, and Gibson struggled in the classroom, often skipping school. However, Gibson loved to play sports—especially table tennis—and she soon made a name for herself as a local table tennis champion. Her skills were eventually noticed by musician Buddy Walker, who invited her to play tennis on local courts.After winning several tournaments hosted by the local recreation department, Gibson was introduced to the Harlem River Tennis Courts in 1941. Incredibly, just a year after picking up a racket for the first time, she won a local tournament sponsored by the American Tennis Association, an African-American organization established to promote and sponsor tournaments for black players. She picked up two more ATA titles in 1944 and 1945. Then, after losing one title in 1946, Gibson won 10 straight championships from 1947 to 1956. Amidst this winning streak, she made history as the first African-American tennis player to compete at both the U.S. National Championships (1950) and Wimbledon (1951). Althea Gibson was the first African-American tennis player to compete at the U.S. National Championships in 1950, and the first black player to compete at Wimbledon in 1951. She also broke racial barriers in professional golf and on July 6, 1957 won the women's singles title at Wimbledon to become the first African American to win a championship at London's All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet club. Gibson was welcomed home to New York with a traditional ticker tape parade on July 11th with thousands lining the streets to celebrate her achievement. 	2016-08-25 17:40:14.969147	\N	f	t	1	http://www.sinuousmag.com/sm/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/wimbledon-1957-althea-gibson-01.jpg	http://www.biography.com/people/althea-gibson-9310580
278	 Althea	Gibson	1927	2003	https://www.womenofthehall.org/	278	Widely regarded as one of the most talented athletes in the United States, Althea Gibson overcame extreme racism to break barriers in tennis and pave the way for talented athletes of all races to compete equally.\nBorn in South Carolina, she moved to Harlem at the age of three. After being given a tennis racquet at the age of 13, Gibson displayed such talent that she was invited to become an honorary member of the elite Cosmopolitan Tennis Club.\nIn 1942, at the age of 15, Althea began playing in the American Tennis Association (ATA) and won the first tournament she ever entered. The ATA was a counterpart to the United States Lawn Tennis Association (now the USTA), which did not allow African American players to enter tournaments at the time.\nIn 1957, Gibson became the first African American to win the All-England Championships at Wimbledon and the U.S. National Tennis Championships at Forest Hills, forever changing the face of tennis. She repeated these feats in 1958.\nAfter retiring from tennis, Gibson went on to play professional golf, again smashing barriers by becoming the first African American to earn her LPGA card.\nAlthea Gibson’s tremendous feats continue to inspire generations of athletes from all races and walks of life.\n\n	2016-08-25 17:40:14.980403	\N	f	t	1	https://www.womenofthehall.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/althea-gibson-150x150.jpg	
279	Lillian	Gilbreth	1878	1972	https://www.womenofthehall.org/	279	Lillian Gilbreth, industrial engineer and expert in motion studies, was a pioneer in recognizing the interrelationship between engineering and human relations. She understood – and convinced industrial managers and equipment developers – that the behavior and efficiency of individual workers was often the product of the quality and effectiveness of the work environment.\nHer ideas helped encourage the development of industrial engineering curricula in engineering schools, and her ideas about the qualities that produce good supervisors and what kind of workers were best suited to particular kinds of work was equally innovative, and contributed to the growing field of career assessment.\nGilbreth developed many of her ideas and co-authored numerous books and scientific studies with her husband, Frank — and while doing so, she had 12 children in 17 years. When she was widowed, she carried on managing the company she and her husband had formed and managed to put all of her children through college.\nGilbreth continued to apply the principles of modern business methods to the home, and published two books about the topic, The Home-Maker and Her Job and Management in the Home, as well as many articles in popular periodicals about the topic.\nGilbreth also had a special concern for the needs of those with physical handicaps, and used the techniques of motion analysis to design special equipment to make housework easier for these individuals. She was also a consultant to the Institute of Rehabilitation Medicine. She was active in volunteer organizations, notably the Girl Scouts and served as a member of the President’s Emergency Committee for Unemployment Relief in 1930 and as an educational adviser to the Office of War Information during World War II.\nShe was named an honorary member of the Society of Industrial Engineers (which did not then admit women to membership) and in 1966 was the first woman to receive the Hoover Medal for distinguished public service by an engineer. She encouraged women to become engineers, and was honored for that commitment by the Society of Women Engineers. Her family is recalled by humorous reminiscences by her children Frank Jr. and Ernestine in the book Cheaper By the Dozen and Belles on Their Toes.\n\n	2016-08-25 17:40:14.991992	\N	f	t	1	https://www.womenofthehall.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/lillian-moller-gilbreth-150x150.jpg	
280	Charlotte Perkins 	Gilman	1860	1935	https://www.womenofthehall.org/	280	Called by Carrie Chapman Catt “the most original and challenging mind which the (women’s) movement produced,” Charlotte Perkins Gilman was a philosopher, theoretician, writer, educator and activist. She demanded equal treatment for women as the best means to advance society’s progress.\nGilman’s landmark work, Women and Economics, was written in 1898. In the book she makes clear that until women learn to be economically independent, true autonomy and equality could not be found. A bestseller, the book was translated into seven languages. Gilman’s denunciation of the romanticization of domesticity as a goal for women was revolutionary. Gilman was a much-sought after lecturer, and she continued to write, producing six nonfiction works, eight novels, nearly 200 short stories, hundreds of poems, plays and literally thousands of essays. Gilman was not often directly involved in the social movements of her time. From 1909 to 1916, she wrote much of and published The Forerunner, a monthly feminist magazine. At the end of her life, she wrote The Living of Charlotte Perkins Gilman: An Autobiography.\n\n	2016-08-25 17:40:15.015819	\N	f	t	1	https://www.womenofthehall.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/charlotte-perkins-gilman-150x150.jpg

281	Ruth Bader 	Ginsburg	1933		https://www.womenofthehall.org/	281	“Justice, justice, thou shalt pursue,” the Old Testament words Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg keeps on the wall of her chambers, epitomize the outlook and achievement of this distinguished jurist. Ginsburg has worked her entire career to eliminate gender-based stereotyping in legislation and regulations. Appointed Associate Justice of the United States Supreme Court by President William Clinton in 1993, she is the second woman to sit on the bench of the United States Supreme Court in its 212 year history.\nAfter graduating from Cornell University in 1954 with highest honors in government, Justice Bader Ginsburg attended Harvard Law School and Columbia Law School, making Law Review in both and graduating at the top of the class at Columbia. Despite these excellent academic credentials, Bader Ginsburg had difficulty finding a job in the male-dominated law profession. She began her career by serving a clerkship in the United States District Court of Appeals in New York, continued by teaching at Rutgers University School of Law, and then at Columbia Law School, where she became the school’s first tenured female professor.\nHer teaching and litigation on behalf of the American Civil Liberties Union, where she headed the Women’s Rights Project, drew national attention. In 1971, she helped write the ACLU brief in Reed vs. Reed, a case argued before the Supreme Court that involved discrimination against women in awarding the administration of a child’s estate. The Court struck down the state law that favored men over women as estate administrators.\nIn 1980, President Jimmy Carter appointed her to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, where she served until her 1993 appointment to the Supreme Court. Justice Ginsburg has become known for her scholarly, balanced opinions and forthright personal courage.

At 82 years old she is championing gay marriage by placing it along the civil rights continuum in a way that her conservative colleagues may find very hard to deny. When responding to the belief that the sole purpose of marriage is procreation, Ginsburg said "Suppose a couple, 70-year-old couple, comes in and they want to get married? ... You don't have to ask them any questions. You know they are not going to have any children."\n	2016-08-25 17:40:15.04947	\N	f	t	1	https://www.womenofthehall.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/ruth-bader-ginsburg-150x150.jpg	
283	Elizabeth	Gloucester	1817	1883		283	Elizabeth Gloucester was an African American activist, abolitionist, and entrepreneur. She was born in Virginia and later moved to Philadelphia, ultimately settling in Brooklyn. She helped organize and raise money for major African American institutions in Brooklyn, including the Siloam Presbyterian Church. She was also a successful businesswomen who owned and ran a number of boarding houses in Brooklyn. When she died in 1883, the Brooklyn Eagle pronounced her one of the wealthiest women in the country.\n\nI find her inspiring because Gloucester was energetic, unflagging, and passionate. I love that she blended an unstoppable commitment to equality with an entrepreneurial spirit. You can learn more about her at Brooklyn Historical Society's In Pursuit of Freedom exhibition, and you can visit her grave at Greenwood Cemetery. \n	2016-08-25 17:40:15.066449	\N	f	t	1		
284	Maria	Goeppert-Mayer	1906	1972	https://www.womenofthehall.org/	284	Maria Goeppert-Mayer silently fought the injustices of the male-dominated field of science while at the same time tackled the mysteries of physics. The first American woman and the second woman ever to win the Nobel Prize in Physics, Mayer made extensive contributions to several different technical fields in physics.\nBy 1930, the same year she was married to Joseph Mayer, Goeppert-Mayer completed her thesis. In it, she calculated the probability that an electron orbiting an atom’s nucleus would emit not one, but two, photons or quantum units of light as it jumps to an orbit closer to the nucleus, a concept still cited today. That same year they moved to the United States from Germany when Joseph received an assistant professorship at Johns Hopkins University. Because the University had strict nepotism rules which forbade the hiring of Goeppert-Mayer, she continued to work without pay or formal academic status.\nWithin nine years, she produced ten papers applying quantum mechanics to chemistry, one of which became a milestone. Also, with her husband, she wrote Statistical Mechanics, a textbook that sold for 44 years.\nAvoiding controversy and with little recognition, she quietly laid the groundwork for the later development of nuclear physics. As her husband changed positions, she continued her work unofficially at Columbia University and later at the University of Chicago. In Chicago, she worked part time as a senior physicist at the Argonne National Laboratory supported by a federal grant. Here she began her Nobel Prize winning project developing the shell model of the nucleus of the atom, the basic model for the description of nuclear properties.\nIn 1956, Goeppert-Mayer was elected to the National Academy of Sciences. In 1959, at age 53, after a thirty-year career, she was appointed a full time professor, with pay, at the University of California at San Diego. In 1963, she was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics.\n\n	2016-08-25 17:40:15.085675	\N	f	t	1	https://www.womenofthehall.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/maria-goeppert-mayer-150x150.jpg

287	Katharine	Graham	1917	2001	https://www.womenofthehall.org/	287	Katharine Graham who had worked in the editorial and circulation departments of the Washington Post, became owner of the newspaper upon the death of her husband Philip Graham in 1963. She served as publisher from 1969 until 1979, and from 1973 until 1991 as Board Chair and CEO. In 1965, she hired Benjamin Bradlee as editor of the Washington Post and together they developed a staff of reporters and editors that moved the paper into the top ranks of American newspapers. Mrs. Graham remained Chair of the Board until her death in 2001.\n“To love what you do and feel that it matters ‚ how could anything be more fun?” said Katharine Graham, when she led the Washington Post. Considered to have been one of the most influential women in the United States, Graham’s courageous decisions to publish the Pentagon Papers, a top-secret government study of U.S. military involvement in Vietnam – after the New York Times had been court ordered not to do so, and to proceed with the Watergate investigation earned her a reputation as a courageous, fair and thorough journalist. She was committed to giving readers full access to important information.\nAs a businesswoman, Mrs. Graham led the Washington Post Company into a conglomerate of newspaper, broadcast, cable, and magazine properties. She believed that editorial excellence and profitability were interrelated. She served on numerous philanthropic boards and received countless awards in recognition of her accomplishments as a journalist, publisher, woman, and entrepreneur.\nIn 1998, Katharine Graham won the Pulitzer Prize for biography with her reminiscence, Personal History. Her story and actions stand as an example for all women that anything is possible. Describing herself as originally a shy, insecure woman, unprepared for the responsibilities she inherited, she became successful and one of the most powerful women of the century.\n\n	2016-08-25 17:40:15.131059	\N	f	t	1	https://www.womenofthehall.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/katharine-graham-150x150.jpg	
288	Martha	Graham	1894	1991	https://www.womenofthehall.org/	288	Recognized as one of the greatest artists of the 20th century, Martha Graham (1894-1991)created a movement language based upon the expressive capacity of the human body. Her creativity crossed artistic boundaries and embraced every artistic genre. She collaborated with and commissioned work from the leading visual artists, musicians, and designers of her day, including sculptor Isamu Noguchi; fashion designers Halston, Donna Karan, and Calvin Klein; and composers Aaron Copland, Samuel Barber and Gian Carlo Menotti.\nInfluencing generations of choreographers and dancers including Merce Cunningham, Paul Taylor, and Twyla Tharp, Ms. Graham forever altered the scope of dance. Artists of all genres were eager to study and work with her, including classical ballet dancers Margot Fonteyn, Rudolf Nureyev, and Mikhail Baryshnikov. She also taught many actors how to utilize their bodies as expressive instruments including Bette Davis, Kirk Douglas, Madonna, Liza Minelli, Gregory Peck, Tony Randall, and Joanne Woodward.\nShe founded The Martha Graham Studio in 1926 after teaching a group of dancers who had been drawn to her work. She remained at the helm for 66 years. During her illustrious career, she created 181 masterpiece dance compositions that continue to challenge and inspire generations of performers and audiences. Through her compositions she personified a commitment to addressing challenging contemporary issues that distinguish her as a conscientious and politically powerful artist, capturing throughout the ages the soul of the American people.\nHer many honors included receiving the Presidential Medal of Freedom from President Gerald Ford, the National Medal of the Arts, named as “Dancer of the Century” by TIME magazine, and featured on a U.S. postage stamp. In 1986, her theater colleagues presented her with the Local One Centennial Award – an honor given only once every 100 years. The first dancer to perform at the White House and to act as a cultural ambassador abroad, she captured the spirit of a nation and expanded the boundaries of contemporary dance.\n\n	2016-08-25 17:40:15.149592	\N	f	t	1	https://www.womenofthehall.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Graham-Martha-150x150.png

294	Sarah 	Grimke	1792		https://www.womenofthehall.org/	294	Sarah Grimke and Angelina Grimke eloquently fought the injustices of slavery, racism and sexism during the mid-19th century. As daughters of a prominent South Carolina judge and plantation owner, the Grimke sisters witnessed the suffering of slaves.\nDetermined to speak out, they were eventually forced to move to the North, where they continued to appeal to northerners and southerners to work toward abolition. They also urged white northerners to end racial discrimination. The Grimke sisters were pioneering women. Among the first female abolitionists, they were the first women to speak publicly against slavery, an important political topic. Faced with criticism from clergy and others that they were threatening “the female character,” they continued their crusade. In 1838, Angelina became the first woman to address a legislative body when she spoke to the Massachusetts State Legislature on women’s rights and abolition.\nActive in the women’s movement, they helped set the agenda later followed by Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Susan B. Anthony, Lucretia Mott and others, calling for equal educational opportunities and the vote.\nOne historian said of Sarah’s writings: “[They were] a milestone on the road to the Woman’s Rights Convention at Seneca Falls” and “central to the feminist writings in the decades that followed.” Sarah was one of the first to compare the restrictions on women and slaves, writing that “woman has no political existence . . . . She is only counted like the slaves of the south, to swell the number of lawmakers.”\nAfter the Civil War, they continued to champion the causes of equality and women’s rights. Through their examples and their words, the Grimke sisters proved that women could affect the course of political events and have a far-reaching influence on society.\n\n	2016-08-25 17:40:15.246994	\N	f	t	1	https://www.womenofthehall.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/sarah-grimk-150x150.jpg

Here two early American religious leaders worshiped. Barbara Ruckle Heck (1734-1804), known as the “mother of New World Methodist” was among a group of followers of John Wesley who left Ireland for New York in 1760. When the going got rough, and faith seemed to fail, she became a crucial force in Methodism’s survival.\n\nFour generations later, in 1828, this was the first church that the Dutch-speaking former slave known as Isabella joined after leaving Ulster County upstate. Though unable to read, she had documents certifying her conversion to Methodism and admitting her to the congregation. By 1843, she announced her new identity, Sojourner, and said the Spirit called her to go forth. She became an evangelist and lecturer of wide fame. \n	2016-08-25 17:40:15.537039	\N	f	t	1	http://www.biographi.ca/bioimages/original.6962.jpg

One year later, she commanded the first battalion of WAACS to serve in Europe, the largest contingent of women serving overseas throughout World War II.\nBy war’s end, Hallaren stood in the highest ranks of WAC leadership, serving as Director from 1947-1953. Many of her military colleagues, male and female, favored the peacetime demobilization of women. Army Chief of Staff Dwight D. Eisenhower believed women were necessary to meet post-war personnel needs. Hallaren, refusing to “write ‘finis’ to women’s contribution,” became the primary exponent and dynamic force advocating permanent status for military women. In 1948, despite strong opposition, Hallaren was instrumental in seeing that the Women’s Armed Services Integration Act was adopted, enabling women to serve are permanent regular members of all of the armed forces, not just in the military in times of war.\nIn 1965, Hallaren assumed direction of new organizations, Women in Community Service, sponsored by a coalition of diverse women’s organizations. Through its program, at-risk women were able to secure job training and economic opportunity. Because of Hallaren’s vision and inspiration, women who might have failed economically and socially, succeeded.\nHallaren was also instrumental in the creation of the “Women in Military Service Memorial,” erected at the entrance of Arlington National Cemetery in the nation’s capital to honor the contributions and achievements of all military women.\n\n	2016-08-25 17:40:15.264017	\N	f	t	1	https://www.womenofthehall.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/mary-a-hallaren-150x150.jpg

Her first job, teaching pathology at Northwestern University, gave her the chance to realize her dream to live at Hull House. There she came to know Jane Addams and other reformers who encouraged her to find a way to apply her scientific knowledge to social problems.\nAlice Hamilton began to investigate industrial diseases.

Industries denied responsibility, and states had no workmen’s compensation laws.\nDr. Hamilton conducted pioneering surveys of industrial disease, and found that European countries not only outdistanced the U.S. in research but also legislated sickness insurance programs.

Using her own floor length hair as a demonstration tool, she focused on customer comfort and individualized consultation. She employed only former servant women, produced her own natural hair care products and developed her own hair and skin care methods. She used only naturally occurring substances and refused the new chemical dyes and synthetic permanents. Harper launched a new business model, which is today known as retail franchising. In thirty years, there were over 500 franchised Harper shops worldwide. Harper customers included royalty, prime ministers, social reformers, men and women.\nThe franchised Harper shops were a powerful economic innovation that changed the realities of poor women’s lives. Hundreds of women became owners, purchasing a Harper shop through her flexible financing. Thousands of women trained and worked in the Harper network.\nHarper was customer focused. She invented the reclining shampoo chair that is today found in salons worldwide. Harper offered scalp massages and other relaxation services and provided childcare and evening hours. Flextime, profit sharing and paid personal time off were employment practices Harper introduced. Harper employees were trained to assure consistency and high quality service. She was recognized in her time as a successful businesswoman and became the first woman member of the Rochester Chamber of Commerce.\nHarper is now acknowledged as a model for such beauty industry women entrepreneurs as: Madam C.J.

1043	Emma	Goldman	1869	1940		1029	Probably the most influential anarchist in American history, Goldman promoted the rights of workers and upended the role of women in New York politics. The Russian-born activist made her name on the streets of Manhattan, stirring Bohemia and workers alike, butting heads with most of New York’s leading industrialists in the process. Her views are controversial because she once ordered the assassination of Henry Clay Frick, for instance. But her powers as an orator and rabble-rouser are unquestioned; her stirring words in Union Square during the panic of 1893 gave voice to the outrage of the city.	2016-08-26 20:49:03.951675	\N	f	t	1	https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/03/Emma_Goldman_seated.jpg/220px-Emma_Goldman_seated.jpg	\N

A woman of many firsts, she was the first African American woman to serve the nation as Ambassador, the first African American woman to become dean of a law school, and the first African-American woman to serve in a Presidential cabinet.\nPatricia Roberts excelled academically and won a scholarship to Howard University, graduating in 1945. She married in 1955, and at her husband’s urging entered law school. She earned her law degree from George Washington University and was admitted to the District of Columbia Bar and to practice before the United States Supreme Court.\nHarris was appointed co-chair of the National Women’s Committee for Civil Rights by President John F. Kennedy. She returned to Howard University as an associate Dean of Students and lecturer in the law school and became a full professor in 1963. In 1965, Harris accepted an appointment as Ambassador to Luxemburg. She then served briefly as Dean of Howard Law School in 1969. In 1977, Harris was appointed as Secretary of Housing and Urban Development. At her confirmation hearing, she was queried as to her ability to represent the interests of the poor. Her response was:\n“I am one of them. You do not seem to understand who I am. I am a Black woman, daughter of a dining-car worker. I am a Black woman who could not buy a house eight years ago in parts of the District of Columbia. I didn”t start out as a member of a prestigious law firm, but as a woman who needed a scholarship to go to school. If you think that I have forgotten that, you are wrong.”\nIn 1980, Harris was appointed Secretary of the Department of Health, Education and Welfare.\n\n	2016-08-25 17:40:15.42536	\N	f	t	1	https://www.womenofthehall.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/patricia-roberts-harris-150x150.jpg

310	Helen	Hayes	1900	1993	https://www.womenofthehall.org/	310	Helen Hayes was known as America’s premier actress and dubbed, “First Lady of the Theatre.” She has described herself as an ordinary woman who led an extraordinary life. But, how many others entered the theatre at age five and at age nine experienced her first hit on Broadway. In 1911 she returned to Washington D.C. to resume acting with the Columbia Players and to finish school at the Sacred Heart Convent. Following a long run of Pollyanna from 1916 – 1918, she began a long and distinguished career. The first actress to earn the coveted Tony award, she performed in more than eighty plays and was the first woman to have two successive Broadway theatres bear her name.\nEntering the world of motion pictures, Helen Hayes then became the first actress from the stage to win an Academy Award, and the first person to win an Oscar in two categories, Best Actress (The Sin of Madelon Claudet, 1931) and Best Supporting Actress (Airport, 1970). Her 88 years as an actress spanned theatre, film, radio and television. Considered “a trouper” with grace and good humor, Hayes possessed none of the airs of a temperamental star and became a perennial favorite with audiences. She is one of the few people to have won an Emmy, a Grammy, an Oscar and a Tony Award.\n\n	2016-08-25 17:40:15.490349	\N	f	t	1	https://www.womenofthehall.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/helen-hayes-150x150.jpg

313	Alexes	Hazan				313	“Why do you want to be a doctor?” Alexes Hazen’s grandfather once asked. “Just be a woman.”\n\nBut Hazen ’87 MD’96 wanted to help people, and though her path was a little more circuitous than most, she finally found her way to medicine. Now an assistant professor of plastic surgery at New York University and director of the NYU Aesthetic Surgery Center, Hazen was a featured speaker at the annual “Generosity and Gratitude” celebration of medical student scholarships on April 23, where she told the audience why she endowed the Alexes Hazen, MD, and Alex Ettl Medical Scholarship.\n\nHer grandfather, Alex Ettl, was a very impressive – and imposing – self-made man. A sculptor, he turned a little family business importing artists’ tools into a nationally renowned company that made large-scale monuments.\n\n“He became a millionaire, and instilled both terror and a work ethic in us,” Hazen said.\n\nSelf-described as a good but somewhat unfocused student, Hazen worked as an AIDS educator in a high risk neighborhood in New York after graduating from Brown and then served in the Peace Corps in Honduras. With a little life experience under her belt, her future came into sharper focus and she realized that yes, she really could be a doctor. She completed the postbaccalaureate premedical program at Bryn Mawr College and returned to Brown for medical school.\n\nHazen said she soon realized how privileged she was – with her parents paying for her tuition, her living expenses, even buying her a car – after seeing the experiences of her best friend, who was also a medical student.\n\n“She had scholarships, loans, jobs … I’d be going to the movies and she’d be going to work,” Hazen says. “She was under pressure to do well and she had to succeed. It was eye opening to me. I decided at that point if I ever had the means, that I would do something so that people had the chance to decide on whatever career they wanted and to go with their heart rather than what makes money.”\n\nThat opportunity came when her grandfather died at the age of 96. He established a foundation with his fortune and appointed his children and grandchildren directors. Shortly after she graduated from medical school, Hazen used some of the funds to establish the medical scholarship that bears her and her grandfather’s names.\n\nAs part of her giving to Boldly Brown: Campaign for Academic Enrichment, Hazen committed additional funds to the medical scholarship last year, in addition to supporting the Brown Annual Fund and the Brown Medical Annual Fund. Her gifts were matched dollar for dollar by the Women’s Leadership Challenge, established by the Women’s Leadership Council at Brown to both honor President Ruth J. Simmons’ commitment to higher education, particularly the education of women, and to inspire greater leadership giving from Brown alumnae. Additional note: Last year, Hazan was part of the most extensive clinical face transplant to date which was successfully carried out at NYU Langone Medical Center. A complete report on this procedure -- including the extensive organizational and training program created to prepare for it -- is published in the July issue of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery®, the official medical journal of the American Society of Plastic Surgeons (ASPS). \n\n \n\n	2016-08-25 17:40:15.528365	\N	f	t	1	http://brownmedicinemagazine.org/scene/content/img/1249331775858386_MG_image.jpg

1050	Barbara	Rabin	1933			1032	My mother rarely saw a problem she didn't try to fix.  In the late sixties when she moved to the south with a husband and three young kids and there wasn't a good public school that was also not segregated, she helped start one.   When there wasn't a synagogue that reflected her progressive values she gathered a group of collaborators and started one.  When "white flight" made it abundantly clear that desegregation didn't necessarily translate into integration, she founded a fair housing organization to combat  discrimination and promote neighborhood integration.  When it became clear that the best avenue for combating discrimination was through the courts, she brought lawsuits against landlords and real estate agencies and insurance companies, ultimately winning a landmark case in the supreme court.  And that was all before going to law school in her 50's - graduating the same year I graduated from  college.  \r\n\r\nShe had an abiding sense of justice and a belief that we all have the responsibility to fix the problems around us.  Her activism was more quiet and matter-of-fact than loud and theatrical but she's been a powerful example to me and others and the parts of the world she touched are better for her having been there.	2016-08-27 03:34:11.076657	\N	f	t	1	\N	\N

She became a volunteer with the National Council of Negro Women when she worked with NCNW founder Mary McLeod Bethune. When Bethune died, Height became president, a position she held for forty years.\n\nNCNW, an organization of national organizations and community sections with outreach to four million women, developed model national and international community-based programs, sent scores of women to help in the Freedom Schools of the civil rights movement, and spearheaded voter registration drives. Height’s collaborative leadership style brought together people of different cultures for mutual benefit. Her belief in the importance of strong families became the primary energy behind the Black Family Reunion Celebration.

She strove to open the doors of engineering education closed to women prior to 1970.\nAt age 13, inspired by the Empire State Building and the George Washington Bridge, she told her engineer father that she, too, would become an engineer. She earned degrees in chemical engineering, electrical engineering and physics, was the first woman engineer employed by Western Electric Company, pioneered in the theoretical study, analysis, development and manufacture of sensing devices, patented a molecular density scanner, and developed an industry model for quality control procedures. In 1955, she became president of the firm founded by her father, Newark Controls, Inc., which designed and manufactured environmental sensing equipment, much of which was used in the space program.\nIn 1950, she was chosen as the first president of the newly organized Society of Women Engineers, which then consisted of 60 members.

She also rose through the ranks to become manager of the Houston Post, one of the nation’s major newspapers.\nIn 1941, Hobby accepted a $1-a-year position as Director of the Women’s Interest Section of the War Department. Army Chief of Staff George C. Marshall instructed her to organize a military unit for women. In 1942 Congress authorized the Women’s Auxiliary Army Corp (WAACS, later become the Women’s Army Corps, WACS). Hobby became America’s first woman Colonel. Her leadership and organizational skills were challenged by recruiting, organizing and training women in a military environment as often hostile as helpful. She and the WAACS met every test. As she often said, “a debt to democracy and a date with destiny.” When she retired in 1945, she had commanded 100,00 women at more that 200 posts and in every theater of wartime operations.\nAfter the war, Hobby returned to the Post, serving as co-editor. From 1952-1955 she played another pioneering role in government as the first Secretary of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare.

The success of Caedmon Records launched the spoken word industry, created a broad audience for diverse, high quality literature, and helped lay the foundation for today’s audio books industry.\nThe Caedmon catalog is extraordinary for the dramatic gender equality and cultural inclusiveness it achieved. It expanded the audience for American women’s writing and women’s writing in general. Ms. Holdridge bridged many different cultures and voices, establishing a legacy of recordings that are a vast resource of American cultural history, at a time when publishing was not open to women’s writing or cultural diversity.\nShe also discovered and documented with her husband, Lawrence Holdridge, the American Portrait painter Ammi Phillips. Phillips was responsible for 700 portraits, many attributed to other artists or to “anonymous.” After the successful sale of Caedmon, Ms. Holdridge founded Stemmer House Publishers, devoted to fine illustrated books and a small list of spoken word recordings.\n\n	2016-08-25 17:40:15.699765	\N	f	t	1	https://www.womenofthehall.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/barbara-holdridge-150x150.jpg	
328	Billie	Holiday	1915	1959	https://www.womenofthehall.org/	328	Considered by many to be one of the greatest jazz vocalists of all time, Billie Holiday triumphed over adversity to forever change the genres of jazz and pop music with her unique styling and interpretation.\nIn 1931, Holiday left employment as a maid to pursue work as a dancer in Harlem nightclubs.  At one of those clubs, she was asked to sing.  She quickly began singing in many of the Harlem nightclubs and soon established a following of admirers, despite having had no formal musical training.\nHoliday’s career began to grow, thanks in part to the interest of John Hammond of Columbia Records, who organized her first recording with Benny Goodman in 1933.  She debuted at the Apollo Theater in 1935, and began recording under her own name in 1936.\nHoliday toured extensively in 1937 and 1938 with the Count Basie and Artie Shaw bands. While on tour, Holiday was often subjected to discrimination.\nPerhaps Holiday’s most notable collaborations were with legendary saxophonist Lester Young, who gave Holiday her moniker “Lady Day.” Together, they created some of the most important jazz music of all time.  Of her groundbreaking vocal style and delivery, Holiday once said, “I hate straight singing. I have to change a tune to my own way of doing it. That’s all I know.”\nAs both a vocalist and a songwriter, Holiday penned God Bless the Child and Lady Sings the Blues, among others.  Her interpretation of the anti-lynching poem Strange Fruit was included in the list of Songs of the Century by the Recording Industry of America and the National Endowment for the Arts.\nHoliday’s autobiography, Lady Sings the Blues, was written in 1956.  She won five Grammy Awards and was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2000 and the Nesuhi Ertugan Jazz Hall of Fame in 2004.\nHoliday, known for her deeply moving and personal vocals, remains a popular musical legend more than fifty years after her death.  In spite of personal obstacles, Holiday inspired many with her vocal gifts and continues to be recognized as a seminal influence on music.\n\n	2016-08-25 17:40:15.715101	\N	f	t	1	https://www.womenofthehall.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/billie-holiday-150x150.jpg

330	Wilhelmina Cole 	Holladay	1922		https://www.womenofthehall.org/	330	A personal interest quickly developed into a social and educational cause for Wilhelmina Cole Holladay. During a tour of Vienna with her husband, Holladay became interested in the work of the artist, Clara Peeters, a contemporary of Rembrant. Holladay was amazed and dismayed to learn that the talented woman artist was not listed in major art references, nor were many other deserving women artists. She also found that the major American art museums had devoted few shows to the work of women artists.\nIn an effort to correct the inequity, Holladay established The National Museum of Women in the Arts (NMWA). Opened in 1987, it promotes a greater awareness of women in the arts and their contributions to aesthetics throughout the ages. Six years after the museum opened its doors in Washington, D.C., it boasted an organization of national and international chapters and a membership of more than 125,000, which makes its the third largest museum in the world in terms of membership.\nTo fulfill its mission, the museum cares for and displays a permanent collection, presents special exhibitions and conducts educational programs.

331	Jeanne	Holm	1921	2010	https://www.womenofthehall.org/	331	Major General Jeanne Holm, USAF (Ret.) was a driving force in achieving parity for military women. After enlisting during World War II as a truck driver in the Women’s Army Auxiliary Corps, Holm graduated from Officer Candidate School and, after the war, received a regular commission in the newly formed United States Air Force. There she held a variety of positions in the United States and overseas, including landmark work with NATO. From 1965 to 1973, as Director of Women in the Air Force, she worked tenaciously to enhance the status and expand the roles and opportunities for women in the armed services. She led efforts to remove outdated laws and policies that discriminated against women in the military. She advocated opening ROTC to women and admitting women to flying programs.\nIn 1971, Holm became the first Air Force woman to be promoted to Brigadier General. Two years later, she became the first woman in all the armed forces to achieve the rank of Major General. Among her military awards are the Legion of Merit and two Distinguished Service Medals. She is also the author of two books detailing the history of women in the armed forces during World War II and throughout history, the most noted being Women In The Military: An Unfinished Revolution.\nUpon her retirement from the military, Holm served President Gerald Ford as a Special Assistant focusing on women’s issues. She initiated a Justice Department review of all laws and policies discriminating against women. As a member of the Defense Advisory Committee on Women in the Services, she advocated the need for the removal of artificial barriers to military women’s careers. She continued these efforts during the Carter Administration as a consultant on military women to the Under Secretary of the Air Force. During the Reagan Administration, she became the first chairperson of the Veterans Administration’s Committee on Women Veterans, successfully advocating parity for women veterans, their benefits, and needs.\nGeneral Holm is recognized as the driving force behind the successful movement for women achieving equal opportunities and equal rights in the military. Her challenge to the military leadership to utilize the talents of military women was the foundation for sweeping increases in the numbers of, and opportunities for, women in the military.\n\n	2016-08-25 17:40:15.751455	\N	f	t	1	https://www.womenofthehall.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/jeanne-holm-150x150.jpg

333	Bertha	Holt	1904	2000	https://www.womenofthehall.org/	333	Bertha Holt was a pioneer in international adoption who became known to thousands of internationally adopted children as “Grandma Holt”. She and her husband Harry, already the parents of six children, adopted eight Korean children in 1955, after seeing a documentary film about the wretched conditions of orphaned Amerasian children in Korea.\nAn Act of Congress was required to allow the Holts to adopt these eight children, ranging in age from eight months to two years. The national attention that followed prompted numerous requests to the Holts for help in adopting children from Korea.\nIn 1956, the Holt Adoption Program, later called Holt International Children’s Services, was established to help hundreds of people interested in intercountry adoptions. Hundreds of thousands of orphaned children worldwide now have families through the efforts of this agency. Her work helped change the world’s attitudes about adoption. She challenged the then established policy of matching children and adoptive parents by appearances and demonstrated that differences in race or national origin are not barriers to forming strong families.\nBertha Holt also became an advocate for children with special needs. She planned and designed the Ilsan Center in Korea to accommodate children with disabilities. Mrs. Holt developed principles for the temporary care of children that are still used today as models.\nNumerous awards and honors were bestowed on Bertha Holt including America’s Mother of the Year, two National Civil Merit Awards from Korea, the Decade of the Child Medallion from the Philippines, and several honorary doctoral degrees.\nThe Holt International Children’s Services, headquartered in Eugene, Oregon, is regularly asked by the United States Congress and by other countries for advice in determining adoption and child welfare policies. Guided always by their motto, “Every child deserves a home of his own,” the Holt agency continues the legacy of its founders.\n	2016-08-25 17:40:15.785159	\N	f	t	1	https://www.womenofthehall.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/bertha-holt-150x150.jpg	
337	Grace	Hopper	1906	1992	https://www.womenofthehall.org/	337	A mathematics genius and computer pioneer, Grace Hopper (1906-1992) created computer programming technology that forever changed the flow of information and paved the way for modern data processing.\nHopper earned her B.A. in mathematics and physics from Vassar College and her M.A. and Ph.D. from Yale.  Hopper began her professional career teaching mathematics at Vassar College, and remained there until the early 1940s.\nIn 1943, wanting to aid her country during World War II, Hopper joined the United States Navy.  She was soon assigned to the Bureau of Ordnance Computation Project at Harvard University, where she began her legacy of groundbreaking computer programming with the Mark I, a precursor to electronic computers.  Hopper became a faculty member at Harvard’s computation laboratory in 1946 and continued her programming work with the Mark II and Mark III computers.\nBelieving that a much wider audience could operate a computer if it was more user-friendly and more programmer-friendly, Hopper joined the Eckert-Mauchly Computer Corporation (later the Sperry Corporation) in 1949.  There, she worked on the UNIVAC I, the first commercial electronic computer.   In 1952, Hopper was credited with creating the first compiler for modern computers, a program that translates instructions written by a programmer into codes that can be read by a computer.  Hopper went on to develop the FLOW-MATIC computer programming language (1957) and shortly after, pioneered the Common Business Oriented Language (COBOL).\nHopper retired from the Navy in 1986 as a Rear Admiral, the first woman to hold the rank.  She continued her career as a consultant to Digital Equipment Corporation, where she worked until her death in 1992.\nThroughout her lifetime, Hopper received many awards and commendations.  In 1969, the Data Processing Management Association awarded her the first computer sciences Man of the Year Award, and in 1973, she became the first person from the U.S. and first woman from any country to be recognized as a Distinguished Fellow of the British Computer Society.  Hopper was awarded the National Medal of Technology in 1991 for her “pioneering accomplishments in the development of computer programming languages that simplified computer technology and opened the door to a significantly larger universe of users.”\n	2016-08-25 17:40:15.851824	\N	f	t	1	https://www.womenofthehall.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/grace-hopper-150x150.jpg

Hunt began her philanthropic work in Denver where in 1981 she, with her sister, Helen, founded the Hunt Alternatives Fund.\nFor 16 years, the Fund gave millions to neighborhood and minority groups, not funded by larger foundations, in the Denver area. Most of these more than 600 grassroots organizations were focused on families in poverty, particularly women and children, and included mental health care, homeless services and battered women shelters, areas of special concern to Hunt.\nIn 1987, she co-founded The Women’s Foundation of Colorado, which makes grants to empower women of all ages.\nIn 1993, President Clinton appointed Hunt United States Ambassador to the Republic of Austria, where she served for four years. During that time she worked extensively as a political and social activist. She brought together business executives, politicians, government leaders, as well as cultural leaders, in order to further U.S. and Austrian interests. Hunt played a key role in the creation of the Bosnian Women’s Initiative in 1996 and within that context, she was the keynote speaker for a women’s conference in Sarajevo with more than 500 participants from all over Europe. She personally funded the Vienna Women’s Initiative, which provided an opportunity for women leaders across all fields to come together to join forces.\nIn January 1998, she became the Director of Harvard’s Women and Public Policy Program (WAPPP) at the Kennedy School of Government. Hunt continued in her role as an educator and supporter of women leaders worldwide. The WAPPP focuses on public policies that significantly impact women and on the women who shape these policies.

351	Rabba Sara	Hurwitz	1977			351	Rabba Sara Hurwitz has modestly risen into a leading role in the Orthodox Judiasm, which is a first for a woman. Rabba Sara Hurwitz was born in 1977 in apartheid-era South Africa. Hurwitz and her family immigrated to the U. S. in 1989 when her parents became more and more disillusioned by the political oppression in their country. Moving from a very insular and quiet community in South Africa to a diverse and hectic Florida neighborhood was challenging. However, Hurwitz found great joy in the communal life of her synagogue, which helped her transition. In 2009, having mastered all the texts required of male rabbinical students, this love of being at her synagogue evolved into a calling when Hurwitz became the 1st woman in the U. S. publicly ordained as an Orthodox rabbi. Though her conferring ceremony was met with some furor, it was also met with tremendous interest from Orthodox women who wanted to serve their communities. As a result, Hurwitz and her mentor, Rabbi Avi Weiss, began a school for women who wanted to pursue rabbinical studies – the Yeshivat Maharat. Six years later, Hurwitz’ dream of no longer being the only “rabba” in the Orthodox Jewish community seems to be closer to becoming a reality. In 2013, the Yeshivat Maharat’s inaugural class included 3 graduates, all of whom immediately found employment in synagogues and schools.\n\nIn speaking of her school, Rabba Hurwitz stated: “I dreamt a dream, and it has surpassed my expectations … Yeshivat Maharat is no longer a dream. It is an unassailable part of the Jewish landscape. Chalom Chalamti. I dreamt a dream, and it became a reality because of the many students, supporters, and advocates, who shared the dream for an Orthodox community where men and women can lead as full members of the clergy.”	2016-08-25 17:40:16.062811	\N	f	t	1	https://www.facebook.com/nycrecords/photos/a.147315912073130.30085.127234500747938/632317156906334/?type=3

She believed in a “covenant of grace,” in which faith alone was enough to achieve salvation. Others disagreed, and when Winthrop became governor, Hutchinson was banished and excommunicated. She moved with her family to the area of the country that became Rhode Island, and after her husband’s death, she moved to Long Island, where in 1643 she and five of her six children were killed in an Indian attack. This advocate of freedom of religion, the right to free assembly and women’s rights was honored in the naming of the Hutchinson River and the Hutchinson River Parkway.\n\n	2016-08-25 17:40:16.093265	\N	f	t	1	https://www.womenofthehall.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/anne-hutchinson-150x150.jpg

From her mother, Bridget Dryden Marbury, she learned the skills she would use all her life - midwifery, healing and herbalism. From her minister father, Francis Marbury, she received a solid theological education, as well as an understanding of the meaning of religious dissent. In 1612, she and William Hutchinson, a prosperous merchant from their Alford hometown, married. With their eleven children, they left England in 1634 to follow early Puritan leader and minister John Cotton to the new colony in Boston, Massachusetts.\n\nIn addition to her many household duties, Anne was healer for the sick and midwife to her child-bearing neighbors. Writings differ regarding the women’s study group she began and its size, possibly eighty or more. Men sometimes joined in, and concerns about fair business practices and religious intolerance probably were discussed. Leaders became worried.\n\nIn our country’s early history, church and state were one, with many of the same men functioning as leaders of both. Although her husband and many others supported her medical and religious activities, her views and popularity were likely too much of a threat to the all-male leaders of the colony. Forty-six years old and pregnant, she was charged as a heretic and brought before the Massachusetts General Court in November, 1637. For two days she defended herself skillfully, matching her extensive knowledge against Governor John Winthrop and her other accusers. Winthrop’s detailed records state that her meetings were intolerable, “nor fitting for your sex.”\n\nHutchinson was not only tried before the General Court, but also faced a second trial by the church. In neither trial was she allowed any defense witnesses! Even so, she might have been freed for lack of just cause and conflicting testimony, except that when she claimed she had received direct revelations from God, her accusers had their “out”. How dare anyone but clergy make such a claim, let alone a woman! Not only did the civil court order her banished, but she was also excommunicated in 1638.\n\nThe Hutchinsons, along with some of their family and followers, travelled to the new and tolerant colony of Rhode Island. There they founded the settlement we know as Portsmouth. While there are no documentson record,  it’s assumed that William died in 1642. Still threatened by Massachusetts leaders, Anne and her party of sixteen moved once more. They settled in the northeast section of present-day Bronx/Lower Westchester, where the parkway and river that bear her name are located. \n\nHer death was likely the result of Dutch land takeovers and conflicting land claims between Governor Kieft and the Native Americans. Because of his brutality to them, she--who practiced racial tolerance and refused to keep firearms--and all but one daughter were murdered in what was probably a retaliatory attack against Kieft in August, 1643.\n\nShe has made her place in history/herstory, an early example of many of our rights today: our right to dissent, freedom of assembly, free speech, religious freedom and tolerance, women’s rights, and separation of religion and government. She had the courage and strength to stand up for her beliefs, even when personal consequences were drastic.

357	Shirley Ann 	Jackson	1949		https://www.womenofthehall.org/	357	Dr. Shirley Ann Jackson, a visionary scientist, educator and public policy innovator, has broken barriers and blazed trails throughout her life.\nDr. Jackson was one of the first two African-American women to receive a doctorate in physics in the United States and was the first African-American woman to receive a doctorate from Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Committed to promoting social justice, she organized MIT’s Black Student Union and worked to increase the number of blacks entering MIT. After only one year, the number entering rose from 2 to 57.\nA renowned physicist, Dr. Jackson was appointed Chairman of the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) in 1995 by President Clinton. While there, she enhanced the commission’s regulatory effectiveness and initiated a bottom-up strategic assessment of all NRC activities. As the first African American woman to serve on the NRC and the first woman and African American to lead the entity, Dr. Jackson reaffirmed that agency’s commitment to public health and safety.\nIn 1999, Dr. Jackson became the 18th President of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, the oldest technological university in the United States, and has led an extraordinary transformation of the school since her arrival through an ambitious strategic initiative known as The Rensselaer Plan.\nDr. Jackson’s numerous awards and wide-ranging work demonstrate the capability of women and minorities to join the leadership ranks in science and technology, education and public policy. A 2007 recipient of the prestigious Vannevar Bush Award for a “lifetime of achievements in scientific research, education, and senior statesman-like contributions to public policy,” Dr. Jackson holds 45 honorary doctoral degrees and is the recipient of countless other awards.\nTime Magazine quite aptly described Dr. Jackson in 2005 as “perhaps the ultimate role model for women in science.”\n        \n	2016-08-25 17:40:16.154107	\N	f	t	1	https://www.womenofthehall.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/shirley-ann-jackson-150x150.jpg	
358	Gertrude Newsome 	Jackson	1923		http://www.acf.hhs.gov/programs/ohs	358	Gertrude Newsome Jackson  was an American community activist in the Delta communities. Via the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, Gertrude was highly involved in the African-American Civil Rights Movement. During her early years in the civil-rights movement, she first began doing community activism on the local school board to fight the sewage backup in the "black" Turner Elementary School that her daughter attended. The sewage pipes ran uphill and could not properly function so the sewage would come back down into the bathrooms. Along with her husband, she helped produce a boycott for black families to keep their children out of Turner until the problem was solved; it took three weeks for their voices to be heard. Soon after the Jackson's first victory, they decided to go after the widespread issue of racial segregation in the Marvell, Arkansas, school district. She established the Boys, Girls, Adults Community Development Center in Marvell to help her community with education, healthcare, housing, and much more. Later in life, Jackson worked for Mid Delta Community Service as a transporter of children to its Head Start Programs.	2016-08-25 17:40:16.168653	\N	f	t	1	https://stream-media.loc.gov/afc/crhp/stills/afc2010039_crhp0004_mv03_768x432_800_thumb.jpg	https://www.loc.gov/item/afc2010039_crhp0004/

President of the Hebrew Benevolent Ladies Society, known today as Jewish Family Service of Colorado, and an officer of the nonsectarian Ladies’ Relief Society, in 1887 she spearheaded the creation of the Charity Organization Society, which became a federation of charities that coordinated fundraising and other efforts and shared the proceeds. This was the model that led to the creation of today’s United Way, which recognizes Jacobs as its founder. Jacobs also founded Denver’s first free kindergarten to help poor children. After her death, a new hospital she had helped found was named the Frances Jacobs Hospital – and today it stands as the internationally-known National Jewish Health, the leading respiratory hospital in the nation.\nJacobs is the only woman among the 16 pioneers honored with stained glass portraits in the Colorado Capitol Rotunda.\n\n	2016-08-25 17:40:16.277113	\N	f	t	1	https://www.womenofthehall.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/frances-wisebart-jacobs.jpg

371	Elizabeth	Jennings	1830	1901	womensenews.org	371	In 1854, Elizabeth Jennings became the first African American to bring a successful lawsuit against race discrimination on public transit in New York City. On Sunday, July 16, on her way to play the organ at church, a conductor on the Third Avenue Railway line tried to eject her because she was riding in a “white-only” car. This was at Pearl Street and Chatham Square, four blocks north of this corner. Two days later, a letter from her was read at a public meeting and on July 19, it was printed in the New-York Daily Tribune. It said:\n       \n"I told him not to lay his hands on me; he took hold of me and I took hold of the window sash and held on; he pulled me until he broke my grasp and I took hold of his coat and held on to that, he also broke my grasp from that (but previously he had dragged my companion out, she all the while screaming for him to let go). He then ordered the driver to fasten his horses, which he did, and come help him put me out of the car; they then both seized hold of me by the arms and pulled and dragged me flat down on the bottom of the platform, so that my feet hung one way and my head the other, nearly on the ground. I screamed murder with all my voice, and my companion screamed out “you’ll kill her; don’t kill her.” The driver then let go of me and went to his horses; I went again in the car, and the conductor said you shall sweat for this; then he told the driver to drive as fast as he could and not take another passenger in the car; to drive until he saw an officer or a Station House."\n\nWith financial aid from her father, Jennings’s lawsuit was handled by a noted white firm. The jury awarded her damages of $225, and the case began the desegregation of the city’s public transit. \n                                                       \n	2016-08-25 17:40:16.374291	\N	f	t	1	http://www.blackpast.org/files/Elizabeth_Jennings_Graham.jpg

She was born in Ireland, but her family was forced to emigrate because they rebelled against British rule.\n\nWhile living in the northeast, she completed school, became a teacher, and married an iron moulder. From her husband, George E. Jones, she learned how workers were struggling against abuses by unscrupulous employers.\n\nTwo tragic events changed her from a bystander to a fighter for the rights of labor. In 1867 Mary Jones lost her husband and four children in a yellow fever epidemic. And as she was rebuilding her life in Chicago four years later, her successful dressmaking business was destroyed in the famous Chicago fire.\n\nDestitute and alone, Mary Jones strongly identified with working people who had no protection against low wages, long hours, and dangerous working conditions. Owners often used blacklists and violence to intimidate workers and prevent unionism.\n\n“Mother” Jones, as she came to be called, was neither frightened nor discouraged. She fearlessly began to organize both men and women to fight for their rights. A fiery and electrifying speaker, “Mother” Jones specialized in creating a public outcry over the inhuman treatment of workers. She once put together a caravan of children on a march to dramatize the evils of child labor. Her most famous efforts were attempts to organize the miners of West Virginia and Colorado.\n\nScorning jail, deportation to other states, and threats on her life, “Mother” Jones became an enemy of the wealthy business owners. Well into her eighties, she continued to agitate and actively assist in the struggle to unionize streetcar, garment, and steel workers.\n\nUnique as a woman in the predominately male labor movement, “Mother” Mary Harris Jones became a symbol of labor’s insistence on its right to decent treatment and wages.\n\n	2016-08-25 17:40:16.432353	\N	f	t	1	https://www.womenofthehall.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/mary--mother-harris-jones-150x150.jpg

382	Afifa	Karam	1883	1924	http://savewashingtonstreet.org/	382	‘Afīfa Karam (عفيفة كرم) was a Lebanese-American journalist, novelist, and translator. A writer for the New York City-based Lebanese daily newspaper al-Hoda, Karam authored three original Arabic novels as well as a number of Arabic translations of novels from English and French. She was an advocate for women’s rights in the Mahjar, or Arab diaspora, and of Arab Feminism.\n\n‘Afīfa Karam was born in the town of ‘Amshit, Mount Lebanon into the wealthy Maronite family of a doctor in the Ottoman army. Karam was educated in local missionary schools until the age of thirteen, when she was married to a relative, John Karam. In 1897 she and her husband moved to the United States and settled in Shreveport, Louisiana.\n\nKaram continued to study Arabic language and literature. In 1903, at the age of twenty, she began to submit her writing to the New York City-based Arabic-language newspaper Al-Hoda (The Guidance). Its editor-in-chief, Na’oum Mokarzel, provided her with Arabic literary texts to read and he personally critiqued her writing. In 1911, he put her in charge of the paper for six months while he was out of the country.That same year, Karam founded a monthly women’s periodical, al-‘Ālam al-Jadīd al-Nisā’ī (The New Women’s World) (1911) which gave way two years later to a second publication, al-’Imra’a al-Sūrīyya (Syrian Woman), founded by Karam in 1913.\n\nAt the age of 23, Karam made her literary debut in the New York City-based Lebanese newspaper al-Hoda (Guidance). She took a six-month hiatus from her journalistic work to devote her efforts to the writing of her first novel, Badī‘a wa Fu’ād (Badi’a and Fu’ad), published in 1906 by Al-Hoda Press. Her second and third novels, Fāṭima al-Badawīyya (Fatima the Bedouin) (ca. 1908) and Ghādat ‘Amshīt (The Girl of ‘Amshit) (ca. 1910) were also published by Al-Hoda over the next several years. Karam’s three original novels all appeared before the 1914 publication of Zaynab by the Egyptian author Muḥammad Ḥusayn Haykal, which is widely considered to be the “first Arabic novel” by the accepted canon of Arabic literature.\n]\nAs a first generation immigrant writer, Karam's literature questioned and negotiated between inherited Arab and American values, and promoted the social emancipation and education of Levantine-American immigrants, particularly the women among them. She criticized restrictive gender roles and practices that she deemed oppressive to women. Karam's stories show man as oppressor and woman as oppressed, and condemn the governmental and religious institutions that uphold such unjust practices in Lebanon.\n\nKaram’s novels did not circulate widely in the Arab world. None of her novels was republished until the centennial republication of her first novel Badī‘a wa Fu’ād by Sa‘īd Yaqṭīn (Rabat: Manshūrāt al-Zaman, 2007). Nonetheless, Karam’s novels are some of the earliest Arabic literary texts written in that form.\n\nThrough the international world of Arabic journalism, Karam was part of the literary scene in Cairo and the Levant, which was the locus of the Arabic literary and cultural Renaissance (al-Nahda). Feminist currents spread among a segment of the Arab intelligentsia, giving rise to the establishment of a number of women’s journals just before and just after the turn of the twentieth century. In an early issue of her journal The New Women’s World, Karam pays homage to the women’s magazines in Cairo, Beirut, and Damascus, calling her own journal their “child.” In turn, literati in Arab countries recognized Karam as a journalist and a novelist and her articles were republished in women’s journals such as Fatāt al-Sharq (Young Woman of the East). Karam was mentioned twice as a biographical subject in that journal, first in 1908, and later in 1924, when its founder Labība Hāshim wrote her obituary. Karam was called the “adornment of women's literature in the New World" and the "pride of Eastern ladies” who "adorned the newspapers with the pearls of her words." Her work was described as “a sword she brandished against traditions, awakening her countrywomen from the lethargy of inaction and ignorance. She walked before them, bearing the banner of literary freedom: ‘woman is the foundation of the nation’s ascent.’”\n\nKaram’s novels and translations include:\nBadī‘a wa Fu’ād (1906)\nFāṭima al-Badawīyya (ca. 1908)\nGhādat ‘Amshīt (ca. 1910)\nNānsī Stāyir (1914) [Arabic translation of Nancy Stair by Elinor McCartney Lane]\nRiwāyat ’Ibnat Nā’ib al-Malik (1918) [Arabic translation of Une fille du régent by Alexandre Dumas]\nMuḥammad ‘Alī Bāsha al-Kabīr (1919) [Arabic translation of Muhammad Ali und Sein Haus by Luise Muhlbach] 	2016-08-25 17:40:16.546747	\N	f	t	1	http://lebanesestudies.news.chass.ncsu.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2016/05/Afifa_Karam.png?9f8f49	https://vimeo.com/66605766
396	Jean	Kilbourne	1943		https://www.womenofthehall.org/	396	Through her pioneering work studying images of women in advertising, Jean Kilbourne has transformed the way in which organizations and educational institutions around the world address the prevention of many public health problems including smoking, high-risk drinking, eating disorders, obesity, sexualization of children, and violence against women. In the late 1960s, she began her exploration of the connection between advertising and its impact on several public health issues, most notably violence against women and eating disorders. Ms. Kilbourne launched a movement to promote media literacy as a way to prevent these problems – a radical and original idea at the time that is today mainstream and an integral part of most prevention programs.\n\nInternationally recognized for her groundbreaking work, Ms. Kilbourne’s speaking, writing, films and videos have impacted the way in which we publicly communicate with each other about ideal beauty, the connection between the objectification of women and violence, the themes of liberation and weight control, the targeting of alcoholics by the alcohol industry, and the image of addiction as a love affair. Her first film Killing Us Softly: Advertising’s Image of Women (and the remakes Still Killing Us Softly and Killing Us Softly 3) are among the most popular and widely used educational films of all time.\n\nIn addition to the many awards and honors she has received, Ms. Kilbourne has served as an authority on addictions, gender issues and the media, and as an advisor to former United States Surgeons General, Dr. C. Everett Koop and Dr. Antonia Novello. She has also provided testimony for the United States Congress. She lectures at a wide range of conferences including those focusing on addictions and public health, violence, women and the media and has appeared on hundreds of television and radio programs to encourage an open dialogue that moves and empowers people to take action in their own and in society’s interest.\n        \n	2016-08-25 17:40:16.818423	\N	f	t	1	https://www.womenofthehall.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Kilbourne-Jean2-127x150.jpg

Chapelle was known as the fearless war photographer who documented conflicts around the world from World War II to Vietnam. She was fearless, reckless, determined, and brave. Chapelle grew up fascinated by air travel and was born in Georgette Meyer in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Chapelle studied aeronautical design at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. After she left MIT, she worked at her local air field as a writer on aeronautics and photographing planes. Chapelle got her interest in photography when she met her husband, former naval photographer Tony Chapelle, when she moved to New York. They got divorced 15 years later. Chapelle achieved a sponsorship from Trans World Airlines and jumped at the opportunity to follow her chosen profession. During WWII, Chapelle worked for the National Geographic as a war correspondent and a photojournalist. She was sent on a mission to cover the battles of Okinawa and Iwo Jima. She spent her time photographing U.S Marines on training missions. Her assignment to Iwo Jima was to document the working nurses aboard the USS Samaritan anchored in the South Pacific and under strict order not to step off the ship. With her strong-mind, Chapelle managed to get onto the shore and photograph the frontlines and the disastrous landscape surrounding her with wasps of gun flew around her. After WWII, Chapelle spent the years covering wars and violence around the world travelling to report war zone stories. In 1956, while covering the Hungarian Revolution, Chapelle was arrested by the Russian accusing her as a spy and she spent 2 months in a Hungarian prison. Chapelle hides a tiny camera inside a glove and tossed it out a window on her way for interrogation. She later wrote about her experience as a Russian prisoner. During the early 1960s, Chapelle volunteered herself to document the war in Vietnam when it started. She documented honest and deep photographs of US troops on a search and destroy missions. In 1963, Chapelle received the National Press Photographers Association Photograph of the Year after the National Geographic published her 1st photograph of a US soldier actively engaged in combat. On an operations with the US Marines near Chu Lai Air Base, a lieutenant walking ahead of her stepped on a tripwire rigged in a landmine and caused the fallen of one of the bravest woman in history. Chapelle was hit by the neck by a piece of shrapnel. In 1965, at the age of 47, Chapelle passed away and reported as the 1st female reporter to be killed in action. She was buried with full military honors, a highly tribute for a civilian journalist. The US Marines remembered her honor by presenting a Dickey Chapelle Award, given to women who are recognizing to contributing to the welfare and well-being of the corps	2017-01-18 18:51:50.107496	\N	f	t	1	http://nojobforawoman.com/dom3684/wp-content/gallery/dickey-chapelle/dickey-chapelle-self-portrait-wwii.jpg	\N
388	 T.C Leontine	Kelly	1920	2012	https://www.womenofthehall.org/	388	Bishop Leontine T.C. Kelly, pioneer religious leader, came from a family of Methodist ministers. Her life as high school social studies teacher, mother of four and wife of a Methodist minister was like that of many other women until her husband’s death in 1969. Kelly then received her own “call” to ordained ministry.\n\nAfter studying at Wesley Theological Seminary and Union Theological Seminary, she received her degree in divinity and became an ordained minister. She was pastor of two churches, held several important positions in the United Methodist Church, and gained a reputation as an excellent administrator and dynamic preacher.\n\nIn 1983, Kelly became Assistant General Secretary in the area of Evangelism for the United Methodist General Board of Discipleship in Nashville, Tennessee. In 1984, the Western Jurisdictional Conference of the United Methodist Church elected her to the episcopacy, the first African American woman to be elected bishop in her denomination. She served as bishop of the California-Nevada Annual Conference and as president of the Western Jurisdiction College of Bishops. She was the chief administrative officer and spiritual leader of more than 100,000 United Methodists in California and Nevada.\n\nAfter retiring in 1988, Kelly served as visiting and adjunct professor of religion at several universities and continued to speak and teach throughout the United States and the world. She also played a significant role in the development of Africa University, a United Methodist-related institution in Zimbabwe. As a role model for women and men all over the world, she mentored and counseled women – both young and old – in the ministry.\n\nKelly was a social activist, advocating many progressive and controversial issues, including the end to nuclear armaments, opening up the church to gays and lesbians, and ministry to AIDS victims. Her work for social justice was recognized with numerous honors and awards, including ten honorary doctorate degrees, the Martin Luther King, Jr. “Drum Major for Justice” and “Grass Roots Leadership” awards from the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, and the California-Nevada Annual Conference’s Leontine Kelly Social Justice Award.\n\nAs a spiritual and moral leader, Bishop Kelly advanced the cause of justice in the United States and throughout the world.\n\n	2016-08-25 17:40:16.6541	\N	f	t	1	https://www.womenofthehall.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/leontine-tc-kelly-150x150.jpg

In 1976, she joined with a handful of other women to successfully lobby for passage of Pennsylvania’s first domestic violence law, the Pennsylvania Protection from Abuse Act.\n\nShe co-founded the nation’s first domestic violence coalition, the Pennsylvania Coalition Against Domestic Violence (PCADV). This group grew from an idea to an official coalition at Kelly-Dreiss’s kitchen table, where women met to raise consciousness and plan their legislative strategy. As the founding Executive Director of PCADV, Kelly-Dreiss oversaw the growth of the network from nine to sixty-one community-based programs now operating throughout the state.\n\nIn 1993, she was instrumental in securing federal funding to establish the National Resource Center on Domestic Violence at PCADV, providing information and technical assistance on domestic violence and related issues.\n\nKelly-Dreiss was a founding member of the National Network to End Domestic Violence. She played a key role in drafting federal legislation including the Federal Violence Prevention and Services Act and the Violence Against Women Act. She has served in leadership positions on family violence task forces under two Pennsylvania attorneys general, and was appointed by Governor Tom Ridge and re-appointed by Governor Ed Rendell to the Pennsylvania Commission on Crime and Delinquency. Kelly-Dreiss was the recipient of a National Crime Victim Service Award.\n\nKelly-Dreiss has mentored and motivated generations of women to carry out the work of the Battered Women’s Movement. Perhaps most importantly, Kelly-Dreiss has demonstrated an unwavering commitment to battered women and their children.

386	Helen	Keller	1880	1968		386	Helen Keller was a writer, lecturer, human rights campaigner, and a pacifist. Keller was a healthy child until succumbing to an unknown illness at 19 months-old which caused her to lose her sight and hearing. As Keller grew out of infancy, she became a bright but unmanageable child. Keller would later describe how her life changed forever at six when Anne Sullivan became a part of it. Sullivan – a 20-year-old teacher who had also experienced problems with her vision – is a pioneer in her own right, as an educator and advocate for people with disabilities. Sullivan’s teaching techniques would ultimately enable Keller to communicate with the world. Having found words, Keller went on to move the world with her story and her continuous achievements. Keller graduated with her Bachelor of Arts from Radcliffe College in 1904, the first deaf-blind person to do so. She also became a successful author, writing an autobiography which has been translated into 50 languages. Although Keller’s passport listed her occupation as “author,” her activism has had as much an effect on this world as her written work. Throughout her life, Keller advocated for worker’s rights, women’s suffrage, support for veterans, and the blind.\nOur photo is a close-up of Keller’s extraordinarily neat signature on a letter written to New York City‬ Mayor Bill O’Dwyer requesting financial assistance for the “Committee on the Deaf-blind of America.” Keller writes, “Try to imagine, if you can, the anguish and horror you would experience bowed down by the twofold weight of blindness and deafness, with no hope of emerging from an utter isolation! Still throbbing with natural emotions and desires, you would feel through the sense of touch the existence of a living world, and desperately but vainly you would seek an escape into healing light.” \nImage Courtesy: NYC Department of Records December 10, 2015	2016-08-25 17:40:16.611635	\N	f	t	1	http://www.afb.org/info/about-us/helen-keller/biography-and-chronology/123	https://www.youtube.com/embed/oxiJ02-hpZY
390	Frances Oldham 	Kelsey	1914	2015	https://www.womenofthehall.org/	390	Frances Kathleen Oldham Kelsey, Ph.D., M.D., physician and pharmacologist, was a leading compliance officer with the Federal Food and Drug Administration. She became nationally known in the 1960s when she withstood great pressure by a leading drug company to quickly approve the drug thalidomide, which was then widely used in Europe primarily to allay morning sickness suffered during pregnancy. Demanding more testing before she would consider approval, Dr. Kelsey saved countless women in the United States from giving birth to terribly deformed children. President Kennedy awarded Kelsey the President’s Medal for Distinguished Service for her exceptional judgment in evaluating this new drug. Kelsey was only the second woman to receive this award – the highest award the government gives to civilians.\n\nDr. Kelsey brought to the FDA the rigorous standards that typified high quality research in major academic institutions. Her alertness and careful review of the thalidomide application and the subsequent evidence of the danger of that drug resulted in significant strengthening of drug legislation in the United States. Today drug companies must prove not only that drugs are safe, but also that they are effective. Perhaps even more important, drug companies now have to submit enough research to the FDA to prove a drug’s safety before it can be tested on humans.\n\nDr. Kelsey helped open the door to women in medical and scientific research by proving that women can compete at top academic institutions. She received her Ph.D. in pharmacology in 1938 from the University of Chicago and became an instructor and then assistant professor of pharmacology there. In 1950, after many years of course work, she earned her M.D. degree, also from Chicago. This was at a time when less than ten percent of graduate students and medical students in her field were women. Dr. Kelsey authored numerous articles in well recognized scientific journals and was the recipient of several prestigious awards and honorary degrees.\n\nA woman of courage and a woman of reason. Dr.Kelsey demaned of herself and others in her profession high standards of science and integrity.\n      \n	2016-08-25 17:40:16.697162	\N	f	t	1	https://www.womenofthehall.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/frances-oldham-kelsey-150x150.jpg

That's how many women have gone through the Women's Research and Education Institute's (WREI) Congressional Fellowship program, which Scanlan founded back in 1980 to teach young women how public policy is really made--not just how it's taught in law school. Scanlan, still president of WREI, but retired from chairing the National Council of Women's Organizations, said that the 150 former fellows who are still in D.C are working on her behalf for gender equality. "I get to brag about the incredible work of all these women," Scanlan said. "So in a way, I'll never stop working."

397	Billie Jean 	King	1943		https://www.womenofthehall.org/	397	As one of the most celebrated tennis players in history, and one of the 20th century’s most respected women, Billie Jean King has dedicated her life to breaking barriers both on and off the tennis court.\n\nBillie Jean Moffit (born 1943) began playing tennis at the age of 11. After one of her first tennis lessons, she told her mother, “I’m going to be No. 1 in the world”, a title she would come to hold five times between 1966 and 1972.\n\nFor more than 20 years, King dominated the world of tennis. As a player, she won 39 Grand Slam singles, doubles and mixed doubles tennis titles, including a record 20 titles at Wimbledon. In 1973, King defeated Bobby Riggs in the most talked-about tennis match in history. The “Battle of the Sexes” was a turning point for women in athletics, proving that skill is not dependent upon gender.\n\nKing’s efforts turned women’s tennis into a major professional sport. Outraged at the disparity between men’s and women’s prizes at major tournaments, King spearheaded the drive for equal prize money and equal treatment of women. She helped establish the Virginia Slims Tour, founded the Women’s Tennis Association and the Women’s Sports Foundation, and co-founded World TeamTennis.\n\nAs a female athlete, King achieved a number of “firsts”. In 1971, she became the first female athlete in any sport to earn more than $100,000 in a single season, and in 1974, she became the first woman to coach a co-ed team in professional sports, the Philadelphia Freedoms. In 1984, King became the first woman commissioner in professional sports history.\n\nIn honor of her contributions to tennis, sports and society, the National Tennis Center was renamed the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center in 2006. In the same year, the Sports Museum of America and the Women’s Sports Foundation announced the Billie Jean King International Women’s Sports Center.\n\nKing is the author of numerous books, including, Pressure is a Privilege: Lessons I”ve Learned from Life and the Battle of the Sexes. In 2009, she was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation’s highest civilian honor.\n\nKing’s groundbreaking achievements spearheaded the women’s movement in tennis, affording today’s female athletes equal opportunity in the world of sports.\n\n	2016-08-25 17:40:16.84127	\N	f	t	1	https://www.womenofthehall.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/billie-jean-king-150x150.jpg

The US tennis legend has won 20 Wimbledon titles, fought for equal prize money for male and female players and in 1973 famously beat Bobby Riggs, a former Wimbledon men's singles champion, for a $100,000 prize in a match dubbed "The Battle of the Sexes" after he taunted her that men were superior athletes.	2016-08-25 17:40:16.895363	\N	f	f	1	https://www.theclio.com/web/ul/5792.6240.jpg	http://www.makers.com/billie-jean-king
402	Elisabeth 	Kübler-Ross	1926	2004	https://www.womenofthehall.org/	402	In her journal, Elisabeth Kübler-Ross wrote, “There is within each of us a potential for goodness beyond our imagining, for giving which seeks no reward; for listening without judgment; for loving unconditionally.”  It was this spirit that directed much of her psychiatric work with terminally ill patients, AIDS patients, and maximum-security prisoners.\n\nShe was born in Zurich, Switzerland, a tiny two-pound baby, the first of triplets. In spite of her father’s objections, Elisabeth was determined at an early age to study medicine and in 1957 received her medical degree from the University of Zurich.  She married Dr. Emanuel Ross, an American, who also studied at the university and they moved to the United States to fulfill their medical residency requirements.\n\nDuring her first residency at Manhattan State Hospital, Dr. Kübler-Ross was horrified by the routine neglect and poor treatment of mental patients.  It was here that she began her life-long approach to medical practice as she developed a program of individual care and attention for each patient.  This protocol resulted in significant improvement in the mental health of 94% of her patients.\n\nShe continued in the field of psychiatry at the University of Colorado School of Medicine.  There she became a teaching fellow and began a lecture series for medical and theological students on death and dying, with terminally ill patients as part of her presentations.\n\nAs an assistant professor of psychiatry at the University of Chicago in 1965, Dr. Kübler-Ross continued these seminars, which were incorporated into her first book, On Death and Dying, a 1969 worldwide bestseller.  This book and her lectures are credited with helping people put aside a long-held Western reluctance to openly talk about death and dying.  This, in turn, helped to strengthen the hospice movement in the United States and to make the study of the psychological, social, and physical issues associated with dying an important and accepted part of medical training.  Based on her many patient interviews, she identified the five now widely accepted stages that patients encounter as they confront death; denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance. Today, these stages are associated with any major loss or life-changing experience.\n\nDuring her career, Dr. Kübler-Ross was associated with 16 different hospitals and universities, wrote more than 20 books, many of which were translated into other languages, received many honors including Time Magazine, 1999, 100 Most Important Thinkers of the Century and numerous honorary degrees.\n\n	2016-08-25 17:40:16.921601	\N	f	t	1	https://www.womenofthehall.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/elisabeth-kblerross-150x142.jpg	
403	Maggie	Kuhn	1905	1955	https://www.womenofthehall.org/	403	At age 65, when many people prepare for quiet years, Maggie Kuhn embarked on the greatest adventure and most important work of her life.\nIn 1970, forced to retire from her career with the Presbyterian Church at age 65, Kuhn and a group of her friends in similar circumstances organized and founded an organization which became the Gray Panthers. The organization was created to work on issues of concern to the elderly, such as pension rights and age discrimination, but also to concern itself with larger public issues, such as the Vietnam War and other social concerns. At the core of the Gray Panthers’ message was that older people needed to seize control of their lives and be in the active world working for issues in which they believed.\nKuhn’s candor, charisma and lively approach to the needs and problems of the old drew major media attention, and the group was successfully launched, coming to represent in the public mind that power and energy that the elderly can represent. Kuhn fought off efforts by everyone from politicians to the managers of nursing homes to treat the elderly like amusing children, instead insisting on a place at the table and voice in decision-making that affected the lives of the old.\nKuhn’s advice to activists interested in creating social change shows the strength of her convictions: “Leave safety behind. Put your body on the line. Stand before the people you fear and speak your mind – even if your voice shakes. When you least expect it, someone may actually listen to what you have to say. Well-aimed slingshots can topple giants. And do your homework.”\nKuhn, who continued to play a role in the Gray Panthers until her death at age 89, is considered by many to have started nothing less than a contemporary cultural revolution, both in terms of redefining the meaning of age and through her insistence on “young and old together.” She and the Panthers have been directly instrumental in enacting significant national reforms, including nursing home reform, ending forced retirement provisions, and combatting fraud against the elderly in health care. She authored several books and an autobiography.\n	2016-08-25 17:40:16.940749	\N	f	t	1	https://www.womenofthehall.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/maggie-kuhn-150x150.jpg

404	Nina	Kuscsik	1939			404	Although international running legend Nina Kuscsik engaged in many sports and athletic activities as a child, she did not begin running – particularly long distance – until her late 20s/early 30s. Inspired by a book on the sport, the mother of three began training with her husband in the late ‘60s. That decision would ultimately put her in the position to break “through the ‘Boy’s Club’ barrier and change the rules so they included women.”\nSince many major marathons at the time barred women from competing altogether, it was an uphill climb for Kuscsik to gain entry into the races. After challenging organizers, Kuscsik and other female runners were allowed to run but still had to argue against separate starts for female and male runners.\nKuscsik can be credited with many early victories for women runners – both on the road and in court. Kuscsik’s lawsuit against the Amateur Athletic Union resulted in the elimination of the “’separate but equal’ starting line requirement.” Kuscsik would go on to win the New York City marathon twice (1972 and 1973), the Boston Marathon (1973), and set a number of records.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        	2016-08-25 17:40:16.956517	\N	f	t	1	https://scontent-lga3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s480x480/13686743_704170469721002_2070453672114273319_n.jpg?oh=93e3a68641102ea63f0625d9052e85fd&oe=5811FDFD	
405	Stephanie L.	Kwolek	1923	2014	https://www.womenofthehall.org/	405	Stephanie L. Kwolek spearheaded the discovery, development and processing of high performance aramid fibers. These fibers, most notably Kevlar offer opportunities across the globe to save lives and assist humanity.\nAs a child, Kwolek was encouraged by her father to learn about nature and enjoyed math and science. Initially, she planned upon a career in medicine, graduated from Margaret Morrison Carnegie College, now a part of Carnegie Mellon University, and earned her BS degree in chemistry.\nSearching for employment to save money for medical school, Kwolek was hired by the Dupont Company for a research position at the textile fibers laboratory. Working with great determination, she earned a transfer to Dupont’s pioneering research laboratory in Delaware. She specialized in low-temperature processes for the creation of long molecule chains that resulted in petroleum-based synthetic fibers of tremendous rigidity and strength.\nIn 1965, she discovered a new fiber, an aramid fiber and a new branch of synthetics, liquid crystalline polymers. Thoughts of medical school faded. Kwolek engaged in four decades of cutting edge chemical research. It was ten years before the first Kevlar bulletproof vests came on the market (1975). Kevlar today has hundreds of uses and has saved thousands of lives.\nKwolek was the recipient or co-recipient of 17 United States patents, including one for the spinning method that made commercial aramid fibers feasible, and five for the prototype from which Kevlar was created. An Inductee of the National Inventors Hall of Fame and the Engineering and Science Hall of Fame, Kwolek won the 1999 Lemelson-MIT Lifetime Achievement Award, the 1996 National Medal of Technology, the Perkin Medal, and the American Innovator Award (1994). She was known for mentoring women scientists and for her contributions to science education of young children. \n	2016-08-25 17:40:16.970844	\N	f	t	1	https://www.womenofthehall.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/stephanie-l-kwolek-150x150.jpg

She generated national attention in 1879 when she accompanied newspaperman Thomas Tibbles of the Omaha Herald on a lecture tour to publicize wrongs against the Ponca Indians. The tribe had been brutally displaced and relocated to unfamiliar grounds, and more than a third had died.\nLa Flesche, going by the English translation of her Native American name Inshta Theumba (“Bright Eyes”), was able to reach influential Easterners and brought about passage of the Dawes Act in 1887, at the time considered a progressive law of benefit to the tribes. \nLa Flesche married Tibbles in 1881 and continued to tour and lecture in America and England. She also became a writer, contributing regularly to a variety of magazines and newspapers. She anonymously edited Ploughed Under, The Story of an Indian Chief. 	2016-08-25 17:40:16.984188	\N	f	t	1	https://www.womenofthehall.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/susette-la-flesche-150x150.jpg	
408	Winona	LaDuke	1959		https://www.womenofthehall.org/	408	Native American land rights activist, environmentalist, economist, politician, and author Winona LaDuke has spent her career working on a national level to advocate, raise public support and create funding for environmental groups. A graduate of Harvard and Antioch Universities, LaDuke has become known as a voice for Native American economic and environmental concerns around the globe.\nLaDuke is an Anishinaabekwe (Ojibwe) enrolled member of the Mississippi Band Anishinaabeg. While attending Harvard University, LaDuke met Jimmy Durham, a well-known Native American activist, and her own interest in issues related to Native tribes began. At the age of 18, LaDuke spoke to the United Nations regarding Native American concerns.\nAfter graduation, LaDuke moved to the White Earth Ojibwe reservation in Minnesota, where she became principal of the reservation high school. There, she quickly became involved in a lawsuit to recover lands promised to the Anishinaabeg people by an 1867 federal treaty. After four years of litigation the case was dismissed, prompting LaDuke to found the White Earth Land Recovery Project. The project’s mission centers on land recovery, preservation and restoration of traditional practices and the strengthening of spiritual and cultural heritage. In 1985, she established the Indigenous Women’s Network, a group devoted to increasing the visibility of Native Women and empowering them to participate in political, social, and cultural processes.\nLaDuke is program director of the Honor the Earth Fund, a national advocacy group that seeks to educate and create public support and funding for native environmental groups. In 1998, her work was recognized by Ms. Magazine, which named her Woman of the Year. Four years earlier she was nominated by Time Magazine as one of the country’s fifty most promising leaders under the age of 40.\nIn 1996 and again in 2000 she was a vice-presidential candidate, joining Ralph Nader on the Green Party ticket. A mother of three, LaDuke has written extensively on Native American and environmental issues.\n	2016-08-25 17:40:17.013891	\N	f	t	1	https://www.womenofthehall.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/winona-laduke-150x150.jpg

716	Wilma	Vaught	1930		https://www.womenofthehall.org/	716	Wilma Vaught, Brigadier General, USAF (Ret.), one of the most highly decorated military women in United States history, broke through many of the bureaucratic and gender barriers that faced women in the armed forces during her nearly twenty-nine year military career. The many “firsts” she achieved helped pave the way for thousands of other military women to be judged based on their abilities, and not their gender. In 1967, President Johnson signed into law a measure finally permitting women to be promoted to the level of generals and admirals. That same law also lifted the quotas that had been placed on women in achieving other ranks. Today, due to the efforts of General Vaught and others like her, women have much more equality and respect, although, as Vaught insists, much still needs to be achieved.\nAfter receiving her B.S. degree in Business from the University of Illinois, General Vaught enlisted in the Air Force in 1957. She rose through the ranks in the comptroller area, serving in Europe, Vietnam and various posts in the United States. Along the way, she achieved numerous distinctions. In 1966, she became the first woman to deploy with a Strategic Air Command bombardment wing on an operational deployment. In 1972, she was the first female Air Force officer to attend the Industrial College of the Armed Forces. In 1980, she became the first woman promoted to Brigadier General in the comptroller career field. In 1982, she was appointed Commander, U.S. Military Entrance Processing Command, North Chicago, Illinois, the largest command, geographically, in the military. In addition, she served as Chairperson of the NATO Women in the Allied Forces Committee and was the senior woman military representative to the prestigious Secretary of Defense’s Advisory Committee on Women in the Service. When she retired in 1985, she was one of only seven women generals in the Armed Forces, and only one of three in the Air Force. She has received numerous military decorations and other honors, including the Defense and Air Force Distinguished Service Medals, the Air Force Legion of Merit, the Bronze Star, and the Vietnam Service Award with four stars. She is also the first woman to command a unit receiving the Joint Meritorious Unit Award.\nBut perhaps General Vaught’s most lasting contribution will be her successful efforts to establish the Women in Military Service for America Memorial Foundation Inc. and raise funding to build the first major national memorial honoring women who have defended their country. As president of the foundation’s board of directors, Vaught spearheaded the campaign that raised over $20 million for the memorial. The memorial, standing at the main gateway to Arlington National Cemetery, is the first major memorial to honor the nearly two million women who have served in our nation’s armed forces. It stands as a place where the American people and visitors from around the world can learn of the contributions that thousands of American women have made to the military and to their country.\n\n	2016-08-25 17:40:22.28153	\N	f	t	1	https://www.womenofthehall.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/wilma-l-vaught-150x150.jpg	
410	Dorothea	Lange	1895	1965	https://www.womenofthehall.org/	410	Pioneering documentary photographer Dorothea Lange, challenged in her childhood by contracting polio and by the abandonment by her father, decided at a young age to become a photographer. After graduation, she obtained work in leading photographers” studios. She became an empathic observer of people in the context of their lives by walking through many parts of New York City.\nIn 1918, Lange and a friend planned to work their way around the world, but were stranded in San Francisco after losing their savings in a robbery. Lange settled in San Francisco, married artist Maynard Dixon and raised their family of two sons. She created commercially successful studio photographs but her most influential work became focused on the visual depiction of people’s changing lives and the interrelationships of people, environment, and major historical events.\nLange became one of the outstanding photo-documentarians of farmers and migrant workers when she worked for the Farm Security Administration during the Great Depression. Her famed photograph Migrant Mother (Nipomo, 1936) has been acclaimed as the summation of the rapidly changing realities of the time. In 1940, Lange became the first woman awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship in photography.\nIn 1942, Lange and Ansel Adams photographed Richmond, California’s rapidly changing wartime communities. Lange sensitized America and the world to the injustices of the Japanese American internment of World War II, through her War Relocation Authority photographs.\nAfter the war, Lange traveled the world with her second husband Paul Taylor, creating photo-essays for leading magazines such as Life and Fortune. She chronicled the new industrial expansion of San Francisco, the societal change from rural small town communities to mass urban culture in America, and photographed scenes across the globe. Her dedication, breadth, compassion, empathy, graphic power, and superb technique set standards that stand today. \n	2016-08-25 17:40:17.045886	\N	f	t	1	https://www.womenofthehall.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/dorothea-lange-150x150.jpg

413	Emma	Lazarus	1849	1887	https://www.womenofthehall.org/	413	“Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free.” These famous words from The New Colossus were written by Emma Lazarus, one of the first successful Jewish American authors. Although best known for penning this sonnet, Lazarus was also a novelist, playwright, teacher and translator.\nLazarus was an enthusiastic student who immersed herself in many subjects, including the study of literature, languages and the arts. As a teenage author, Lazarus enjoyed the emotional and financial support of her father, a successful sugar merchant.\nLazarus’s growing position as part of New York’s literary elite afforded her the opportunities to interact with and gain inspiration from notable authors like George Eliot and Ralph Waldo Emerson. In fact, Lazarus viewed Emerson as a mentor throughout much of her early career.\nLazarus often used her writings to advocate against anti-Semitism and for the creation of a Jewish homeland. In the 1880s, considered as perhaps her most productive period, Lazarus published Songs of a Semite: The Dance to Death and Other Poems. It was celebrated by many as her best work and consisted of Jewish-themed poems and a lyric drama.\nThrough her 1882-1883 essays in the Century, Lazarus put forth the notion of a Jewish homeland in Palestine. She was an important forerunner of the Zionist movement, having argued for the creation of a Jewish homeland thirteen years before the term Zionist was even coined.\nIn 1883, Lazarus wrote The New Colossus for an auction to raise money for the Statue of Liberty’s pedestal. It was later inscribed in bronze beneath the statue and has come to symbolize a universal message of hope and freedom for immigrants coming to America. In 1924, the Statue of Liberty was declared a national monument.\n	2016-08-25 17:40:17.093568	\N	f	t	1	https://www.womenofthehall.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/emma-lazarus-150x150.jpg	
414	Frances	Lear	1923	1996	http://www.nytimes.com/1996/10/01/us/frances-lear-a-mercurial-figure-of-the-media-and-a-magazine-founder-dead-at-73.html?pagewanted=all	414	Frances Lear, a mercurial figure in the media world who spent some $25 million she received in a divorce settlement to start a magazine named after herself, died yesterday at her home in Manhattan. She was 73.\n\nShe died of breast cancer, said Dr. Jonathan LaPook, her son-in-law.\n\nMs. Lear was married for 28 years to Norman Lear, the highly successful television producer of series like ''All in the Family'' and ''Maude.'' Her divorce settlement from Mr. Lear, an amount variously estimated to be between $100 million and $112 million, was one of the largest ever recorded.\n\n''I was very much a part of his thinking,'' she often said, justifying the amount of the settlement. ''Norman could not have done his shows without me.''\n\nIt is generally considered -- and she herself claimed -- that she was the inspiration for Maude, the feisty and opinionated title character played by Bea Arthur.\n\nMs. Lear made a name for herself among feminists, working in political campaigns, including Eugene McCarthy's Presidential campaign in 1968; with the National Organization for Women on behalf of the Equal Rights Amendment, which was not ratified; as a partner in an executive search firm specializing in placing women, and as a writer, producing articles for a number of national publications. But she believed that she had faded into the background as her husband's career took off in the 1970's. After Mr. Lear acquired his own movie studio and founded his own civil liberties group, People for the American Way, she discussed her frustrations in an Op-Ed piece in The New York Times in 1981.\n\nA woman in Hollywood is a nonperson, she wrote, ''unless she is under 21, powerful or a star.'' She noted, too, that an industry wife was looked through, never at. In a later interview, recalling her years as a Hollywood wife, she said she had felt constantly ignored and undervalued, had had little self-esteem and had often been depressed.\n\nMs. Lear, in her own words, ''always aspired to something out of the ordinary,'' and she moved to New York after her divorce in 1985. She quickly set out to change the nonperson identity she had felt in Hollywood by creating Lear's, a magazine aimed at women like herself -- ''the woman who wasn't born yesterday,'' as the magazine said on its cover.\n\nContinue reading the main story\n\nLear's began publication in 1988 and was a success. It began with a circulation base of 250,000 and grew to 350,000 in a year. But after two years, Ms. Lear abandoned her original concept and lowered the age of the theoretical Lear's woman to over 35. Abandoning the older-age niche put the magazine into competition with other women's magazines, and its advertising never recovered from the move.\n\nAlmost immediately after the magazine's debut, Ms. Lear developed a reputation for being unpredictable and hot-tempered. She held a series of intimate lunches in her apartment during which she sought, and then usually ignored, advice for her fledgling publication. She also frequently brought up more of her personal history than most of her guests were prepared for, revealing that she had a Dickensian childhood, that doctors had determined that she was manic-depressive and had prescribed lithium for her condition, that she was an alcoholic and that she had made several suicide attempts over the years.\n\nThere ensued a revolving door of editors and writers, many of whom complained of Ms. Lear's inexperience and capricious decisions. Numerous articles were accepted and not published, and layouts were changed at the last minute. In an article in The New York Times, a staff member recalled that when Ms. Lear had been told that she could not change a quotation, she had shouted, ''It is my magazine, and I will do what I want.''\n\nA former associate once said of her, ''She spent her life in Hollywood, where you go on your gut and you are prized for being slightly nuts.'' Ms. Lear did not deny the validity of the remark. She had lived with that behavior for many years, she said, and ''very possibly some of it rubbed off.''\n\nAlthough circulation was more than 500,000 in its final months, Lear's ceased publication in March 1994. It had lost an estimated $25 million to $30 million in its six years of operation.\n\nMs. Lear then formed Lear Television, investing $500,000 in a video production company. The videos, which she referred to as ''television books,'' were specifically for women and dealt with subjects like personal finances and relationships. She had also just completed a book, ''Frances Lear's Guide to Work and Family in the 21st Century,'' which does not yet have a publisher.\n\nMs. Lear was born on July 14, 1923, at the Vanderheusen Home for Wayward Girls in Hudson, N.Y., the child of an unwed mother and an unknown father. ''The odds were stacked high against me,'' she once said. She was given the name Evelyn, but she was renamed Frances when she was adopted after 14 months in an orphanage by Aline and Herbert Loeb of Larchmont, N.Y.\n\n''Aline was outwardly affectionate with me for my father's sake, but she did not like me,'' Ms. Lear wrote in ''The Second Seduction,'' (Alfred A. Knopf, 1992) an autobiography that pulled no punches. The slim volume laid out in harrowing detail her personal history and most intimate experiences.\n\nThe memoir related her years of sexual abuse, beginning at age 12, by the man whom her adoptive mother married after Mr. Loeb committed suicide during the Depression. She told, too, of being sent to a psychiatrist, to whom she revealed her stepfather's abuse, and of the psychiatrist's betrayal in repeating her confidences to her mother and stepfather. Her stepfather, she wrote, ''met me at the door with a kitchen knife in his hand.'' Her mother ''turned and left the room, went into her bedroom, closed the door and protected her economic hide.'' On her mother's death, her stepfather was left 90 percent of the $100,000 remaining from Mr. Loeb's insurance, Ms. Lear said.\n\nMs. Lear attended the Mary A. Burnham School for Girls in Northampton, Mass. In the 1940's and early 50's, she held a number of jobs, primarily in advertising and retailing in New York. She was, she never hesitated to say, dismissed from most of them for behavior like listening in on the boss's telephone conversations and drinking through lunch.\n\nFor a brief period, she was the camera girl at the Copacabana nightclub in New York. The job ended when she asked Frank Costello, the camera-shy gangster, whether he would like to have his picture taken. Her boss grabbed her under her armpits, lifted her into the air, carried her into the street, set her down, kissed her goodbye and advised her to try another line of work.\n\nMs. Lear had two short-lived marriages before she met Mr. Lear. Her first marriage, to Arnold Weiss, a traffic manager at the Navy Yard in Charleston, S.C., lasted less than two years. Her second marriage, to Morton Kaufman (''or Kauffman or Kaufmann -- I cannot remember how to spell my second husband's name,'' she wrote in the autobiography), was dissolved within a year. She said that he had been unfaithful, leading to her first suicide attempt and three weeks in the psychiatric ward at Bellevue Hospital.\n\n''I tried to commit suicide three times seriously and three times with minimal interest in the outcome,'' she once said.\n\nShe was 33 and a buyer for better active sportswear at Lord & Taylor when she married Mr. Lear, who was then a television writer, and moved to California. She turned down a buyer's job with a Los Angeles store and concentrated on homemaking and rearing her two daughters.\n\nOne day, she recalled, she realized that ''we had become he.'' She began to think seriously of leaving her marriage. It took her 15 years, she said, ''to work up the courage.''\n\n''I believe the second half of one's life is meant to be better than the first half,'' she said in an interview last year. ''It is certainly true of me.''\n\nMs. Lear is survived by her two daughters, Maggie Beth Lear and Kate Breckir Lear (who is married to Dr. LaPook), both of Manhattan, and two grandsons.\n	2016-08-25 17:40:17.108195	\N	f	t	1	http://www.azquotes.com/picture-quotes/quote-i-believe-the-second-half-of-one-s-life-is-meant-to-be-better-than-the-first-half-the-frances-lear-61-58-36.jpg\n	https://charlierose.com/videos/14468

746	Edith	Wharton	1862	1937	https://www.womenofthehall.org/	746	Considered one of the major American novelists and short story writers of the 20th century, Edith Wharton was known for her unflinching portrayal of the societal norms of her time.\nWharton was raised in the highly stratified and wealthy society of the urban Northeast. Although she published a volume of poetry at the age of 16, it was not until almost 20 years later that she began her literary career earnest. Following publication of several short stories, her first book, The Decoration of Houses (1897), had a pronounced influence on the styles of interior decoration of the day. Her first novel, The Valley of Decision (1902), was published when Wharton was 40. From then on, she averaged more than a book a year for the rest of her life.\nThe majority of Wharton’s works provided keen, and sometimes harsh, observations of society’s upper strata. Her upbringing provided her with insights on the upper class, while her sense of humor and polished prose made the reading interesting to a wide audience. Her attention to the physical contexts in which her characters lived led Edmund Wilson to describe Wharton not only as “the pioneer, but the poet, of interior decoration.” In the early 1900’s, Wharton changed her focus and created the memorable and eerie Ethan Frome (1911) and Summer (1917). These were followed by The Age of Innocence (1920), a Pulitzer Prize winner that explored social hypocrisy and convention with sharp irony.\nWharton was a member of the National Institute of Arts and Letters and the American Academy of Arts and Letters. She also was the first woman to receive an honorary doctorate from Yale University. During World War I, the writer aided refugees and the wounded. At one time she fed and housed 600 war orphans at her own expense. The French and Belgian governments officially honored her wartime service.\n	2016-08-25 17:40:22.756643	\N	f	t	1	https://www.womenofthehall.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Wharton-Edith1-150x150.jpg	
415	Lilly	Ledbetter	1938		https://www.womenofthehall.org/	415	For more than a decade, Lilly Ledbetter fought to achieve pay equity.\nIt was in Alabama, where Ledbetter was born and raised, that she began a crusade that would eventually lead her all the way to the nation’s capital.\nIn 1979, Ledbetter took a job at the Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company in Gadsen, Alabama.  Although she was the only woman in her position as an overnight supervisor, Ledbetter began her career earning the same salary as her male colleagues.  By the end of her career, however, Lilly was earning less than any of the men in the same position.\nAlthough she signed a contract with her employer that she would not discuss pay rates, just before Ledbetter’s retirement an anonymous individual slipped a note into her mailbox listing the salaries of the men performing the same job.  In spite of the fact that Ledbetter had received a Top Performance Award from the company, she discovered that she had been paid considerably less than her male counterparts.\nLedbetter filed a formal complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and later initiated a lawsuit alleging pay discrimination.  After filing her complaint with the EEOC, Ledbetter, then in her 60s, was reassigned to such duties as lifting heavy tires. The formal lawsuit claimed pay discrimination under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Equal Pay Act of 1963.\nAlthough a jury initially awarded her compensation, Goodyear appealed the decision to the U.S. Supreme Court.  In 2007, the Supreme Court ruled on the Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. case.  In a 5-4 decision, the court determined that employers cannot be sued under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act if the claims are based on decisions made by the employer 180 days ago or more.  Due to the fact that Ledbetter’s claim regarding her discriminatory pay was filed outside of that time frame, she was not entitled to receive any monetary award.\nSince that decision, Ledbetter has lobbied tirelessly for equal pay for men and women.  Her efforts finally proved successful when President Barack Obama signed the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act into law on January 29, 2009.\nLedbetter said of her continuous and persistent efforts, “I told my pastor when I die, I want him to be able to say at my funeral that I made a difference.”\n	2016-08-25 17:40:17.124043	\N	f	t	1	https://www.womenofthehall.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/lilly-ledbetter-150x150.jpg

In 1984, she helped found the U.S. Committee for the United Nations Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM), and became vice president of the that organization.\nShe was the recipient of countless awards and honors. Leet is best known for creating TrickleUp, Inc., with her late husband Glen Leet. TrickleUp, launched in 1979, with $1,000 of the couple’s own money, it is now a leading international nonprofit organization that has assisted more than 500,000 of the world’s poorest people build their own businesses, educate themselves and their children, and become contributors to their communities.\nOne of the originators of micro-enterprise capitalization, the TrickleUp program has helped start over 100,000 businesses, aided the original entrepreneurs and their families through small start-up grants, training and technical assistance. The professionalism, integrity, organization, and unsurpassed vision of TrickleUp have made its pioneering program one of the leaders of the micro-enterprise movement.

"It was overhearing my mom," she said. "I was 11 years old, and I remember her talking to a neighbor: 'What we want for Marcy is for her to marry well.' I got so angry . . . And I hadn't even read 'The Feminine Mystique' yet," she added, citing Betty Friedan's 1963 feminist classic. At the same time, as the eldest of six children, Syms assumed many household tasks. Reading Friedan, Syms realized she didn't want to be "like the women who could not make their own choices and had to ask their husbands for allowances." She started working in the summers at age 14 and at any job she could get during the school year. In 1978, her father asked her to join him at Syms Corp. By the time she became CEO in 1998, the company had 2,500 employees and 37 stores in 16 states.\n	2016-08-25 19:26:35.324492	\N	f	t	1

421	Joan Struder	Levine				421	Joan Studer Levine was born to an activist family during the Great Depression, always surrounded by talk of workers struggling for their rights. At 7 years old, she organized what she thought was a sit–down strike in her classroom against the hated “rest hour.” In high school and college, she was active in groups seeking equality, justice and peace.\n\nAs an elementary school teacher and later a teacher trainer and administrator, Joan introduced new educational methods to better engage the interest and talents of the students. In 1991, she was appointed Adjunct Associate Professor in the School of Education at New York’s City College. Here she spent 13 glorious years helping new teachers become avid learners and teachers of social studies.\n\nA long-time resident of Morningside Gardens, a housing cooperative in the Morningside Heights section of Manhattan, Levine was appointed Chair of the Morningside Gardens Community Relations Committee in 1994. She was troubled by the lack of contact between her middle income co-op and the public housing neighbors across the street. When both complexes were affected by a serious neighborhood garbage crisis, Joan sought out the new President of Grant Houses Residents’ Association for help. Working together, the Morningside Gardens Community Relations Committee and the Board of the Residents’ Association of Grant Houses solved the immediate problem but, more importantly, they learned that working together made them a stronger and more effective force for change in the community. Together, they joined with other block associations to form the Morningside Heights/West Harlem Sanitation Coalition. A member of the New York City Environmental Justice Alliance, the Coalition works on both neighborhood issues and citywide environmental justice campaigns.\n\n	2016-08-25 17:40:17.327104	\N	f	t	1		
422	Augusta	Lewis	1848	1920	womensenews.org	422	In the 1860s, 26 Ann Street held the offices of the weekly New York Era. Here the teenage Augusta Lewis came to learn typesetting, entirely a hand process in those days.  She soon became one of the swiftest and most accurate in the trade. In those days, women printers were often hired to supply cheap help during labor disputes with unionized printers. But Gussie Lewis would have none of that. Elizabeth Cady Stanton had her fired when Lewis tried to organize a union in the printing shop of Stanton’s newspaper. In response, Lewis organized the first and only chapter of the Women’s Typographical Union and, at the 1870 convention of the National Typographical Union, petitioned:\n\n"We beg to call your attention to the large number of women working at the trade, whose neglected interests, uncared-for welfare, and disorganized labor are obstacles to your perfect organization, a detriment to the trade, and disastrous to the best interests of printers. Heretofore women compositors have been used to defeat the object for which you have organized—have been the prey of those philanthropic persons who employ women because they are cheap—their labor has been used during strikes to defeat you. When that object has been accomplished they are set adrift, disorganized and unprotected, their necessity compelling them to work for a price at which they cannot earn a living, and which tends to undermine your wages. In view of these facts, and the injustice we have done you, as well as ourselves, and believing the interests of Labor—whether that labor be done by male or female—are identical, and should receive the same protection and the same pay, we, the women compositors of New York, have taken the initiative in this, and formed the Women's Typographical Union No. 1, of New York." \n	2016-08-25 17:40:17.350013	\N	f	t	1	http://www.cwhf.org/media/upload/images/Inductees/Troup_Augusta_132.jpg	
423	Maya	Lin	1956		https://www.womenofthehall.org/	423	Maya Lin, architectural designer and sculptor, blazed across the consciousness of America when, as a 21-year old architecture student at Yale University, she won the design competition for the Vietnam Veterans War Memorial.\n\nHer visionary design, selected from a field of 1,420 entries, inspired interaction between viewers and the memorial. It made no political statement but commemorated the sacrifice and heroism of every service person through engraving the names of all the fallen in chronological order of loss on two highly polished, black granite, intersecting walls. Its silent, massive, shining presence, two V-shaped wings, one pointing to the Lincoln Memorial and the other to the Washington Monument, opened officially to the public November 11, 1982. It has become the most visited monument in Washington, DC and one of the most well-known memorials in the world.\n\nIn 1981, her selection stirred reflection, debate, opposition, and intense controversy. By 1989, when her design for the Southern Poverty Law Center’s Civil Rights Memorial in Montgomery, Alabama was completed, Maya Lin was established as a pre-eminent architectural designer.\n\nOver the last few decades, she has executed numerous other architectural projects such as private homes, landscape sculptures and other memorials. Her co-design of the Museum of African Art, Pennsylvania Station, sculptural works such as Topographic Landscape, the Wave Field located at the Francois-Xavier Bagnoud building for aerospace engineering at the University of Michigan, Ten-Degrees North at the Rockefeller Foundation in New York City, Avalanche, Groundswell at the Wexner Center for the Arts at Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, and the traveling Topologies show treat the themes of love of nature, landscape and the environment, while utilizing technological elements.\n\nShe draws inspiration from widely diverse sources; her Chinese-American immigrant heritage, Japanese gardens, European multi-use parks such as Denmark’s Norbrow, Hopewell Indian earthen mounds, and American earthworks artists of the 1960s and 1970s. Weaving an American fabric from differing threads, Maya Lin broke opened new avenues and expanded public understanding. Focusing on “how humanity deals with mortality in the built form,” she connects the viewer, through immediate sensory experience, with major historic events. Inspiring thoughtful examination, emotional bonding and the reconciliation of oppositions, Maya Lin’s work has promoted human rights and changed the way people view the world and the events of their times.\n	2016-08-25 17:40:17.365856	\N	f	t	1	https://www.womenofthehall.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/maya-y-lin-150x150.jpg

She received her college education at the University of California at Los Angeles and became a world-renowned educator, making her home at the Standing Rock Lakota Reservation in South Dakota.\nDuring her more than 40 years as an educator, Native American languages and culture were suppressed by official schools that served indigenous peoples. She worked tirelessly to change that situation, becoming a preserver of the languages, cultures and spiritual traditions of Native Americans and other indigenous peoples. Serving as an instructor, curriculum designer and executive of the International Native Languages Institute, she influenced changes in Federal law, helped organize 17 tribally run Lakota colleges and was recognized for her creative and indefatigable efforts by being awarded a MacArthur Foundation Fellowship in 1991. She served as President of the National Indian Education Association, as Chair of the American Indian Advisory Committee of the Martin Luther King, Jr. Holiday Commission, wrote a regular column for the Lakota Times, “Unlocking Education,” wrote or contributed to more than two dozen published articles, and served as a member of many advisory boards of organizations dedicated to social justice, human rights and environmental issues.\nPatricia Locke developed policies, procedures and education codes for Indian communities in several regions of the country. She co-chaired the United States Department of Interior Task Force on Indian Education Policy and helped develop a Bureau of Indian Affairs Mission Statement and policies that were written into statute.\nShe was an active advocate for the American Indian Religious Freedom Act of 1978, which guaranteed Native Americans the right to freely practice their spiritual traditions,\nand was a strong voice for tribal independence in deciding how and what Native American children should study. She became instrumental in starting Native American run colleges and developing educational curricula on reservations across the country.\nShe taught and lectured at UCLA, San Francisco State University, Alaska Methodist University, the University of Colorado, and the University of Southern Maine. She was active internationally at the World Assembly of First Nations in Canada (1982), Chair of the Indigenous Women’s Caucus at Beijing (1995), and among the speakers at the Parliament of World Religions, Cape Town, South Africa (1999). Late in her life, Patricia Locke accepted the Baha”i faith and became the first Native American woman to be elected to an office of the National Spiritual Assembly (1993).\n	2016-08-25 17:40:17.391044	\N	f	t	1	https://www.womenofthehall.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/patricia-a-locke.jpg

After a move to Washington, D.C., she married Ezekiel Lockwood. She was nearly forty when she decided to study the law. She finally found a law school that would admit her, but even there her diploma was held up until she demanded action.\nLockwood was admitted to the bar of the District of Columbia, but was refused admission to practice before the Supreme Court. She spent five years energetically lobbying a bill through Congress, and in 1879 Belva Lockwood became the first woman to practice law before the US Supreme Court.\nIn 1884 she accepted the nomination of the National Equal Rights Party and ran for president. Although suffrage leaders opposed her candidacy, Lockwood saw it as an entering wedge for women. She polled over 4,000 votes and ran again in 1888.\nUsing her knowledge of the law, she worked to secure woman suffrage, property law reforms, equal pay for equal work, and world peace.

435	Juliette Gordon 	Low	1860	1927	https://www.womenofthehall.org/	435	An educator and humanitarian, Juliette Gordon Low made history as the founder of the Girl Scouts of the USA, the largest organization for girls in the world.\nLow earned the nickname “Daisy” at an early age and quickly became known for her stubborn but charismatic spirit. In her youth, Low developed a passion for the arts and often painted, performed plays, sketched and wrote poetry.\nFollowing her education, Low traveled throughout the United States and Europe.  She met and married a wealthy Englishman, William Mackay Low (1886); however, the couple’s marriage quickly fell apart and the Lows were separated at the time of William’s death in 1905.\nIn 1911, while in England, Low began a close friendship with Sir Robert Baden-Powell, founder of the Boy Scouts and Girl Guides.  Low quickly became interested in the Girl Guides program, believing that girls should be given the opportunity to develop physically, mentally and spiritually outside of isolated home environments.  She returned to Savannah, Georgia and on March 12, 1912, held a meeting to register eighteen girls as members of the American Girl Guides.  In 1913, the name of the organization was changed to the Girl Scouts, and in 1915, the Girl Scouts of the USA was incorporated.  Low served as the organization’s first president and gave freely of her own money in the early years.\nHaving suffered from the improper treatment of an ear infection in her youth and from a punctured eardrum in her twenties, as an adult, Low was completely deaf in one ear and nearly deaf in the other.  She was known to exaggerate her deafness when she pretended not to hear friends who tried to beg off commitments to work for the Girl Scouts.  When attending a fashionable luncheon, she would trim her hat with carrots and parsley, exclaiming to guests, “Oh is my trimming sad?  I can’t afford to have this hat done over – I have to save all my money for my Girl Scouts.  You know about the Scouts, don’t you?”\nToday, Girls Scouts is the preeminent leadership development organization for girls.\n	2016-08-25 17:40:17.577347	\N	f	t	1	https://www.womenofthehall.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/juliette-gordon-low-150x150.jpg

Lucid grew up during the 1940s and 1950s when women rarely thought of careers in the sciences and aviation, but ignored conventional restrictions to pursue a dream. Confronted by discriminatory attitudes, she persisted, earning a Ph.D. in biochemistry from the University of Oklahoma in 1973.\nDr. Lucid broke ground in 1979, when she became a member of the first astronaut class to admit women. She went on to become the first woman to hold an international record for the most flight hours in orbit by any non-Russian, and, until June 2007, she also held the record for the most flight hours in orbit by any woman in the world – 5,354 hours or 223 days in space.  Moreover, the science experiments she performed during her five highly visible space flights broke new ground in spacecraft deployment, earth science studies, space materials processing, biomedical experimentation and atmospheric ozone research.\nDuring her six-month flight aboard the Russian Space Station Mir, Dr. Lucid performed space experiments with poise and professionalism while enduring orbital problems and delays. She was a pioneer role model and diplomat par excellence, becoming highly respected and genuinely liked by the Russian crew members as well as by the Russian people.\nDr. Lucid became the ninth person and the first woman to receive the Congressional Space Medal of Honor (1996).  She retired from NASA in January 2012.\n	2016-08-25 17:40:17.620197	\N	f	t	1	https://www.womenofthehall.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/shannon-w-lucid-150x150.jpg

We were in rural Maine and my father, barely making ends meet, declined to purchase it.\r\n\r\nMy mother, the power behind the throne, though she had no ownership interest, insisted and he found the money to buy it.\r\n\r\nThe following year, a girls camp, which had similarly declined to purchase land in their neighborhood, was faced with a trailer park that had to be bought at a premium price.\r\n\r\nMy mother's busimess instincts proved correct, both in the short and long term.

In 1837 Mt. Holyoke Female Seminary opened with 80 students. It was an immediate success, besieged by more students than could be accommodated.

445	Ruth	MacLaughlin	1968		www.nycgovparks.org/	445	Ruth Peterson MacLaughlin was a Riverdale resident and an assistant to former Bronx Borough President Herman Badillo, who worked for many years to improve the quality of life in the Bronx. MacLaughlin was born on July 10, 1910 in Portland, Oregon, and attended college in Los Angeles, California. The beauty of the natural surroundings of her hometown, the Rose City, also inspired her to help develop new parks in the urban landscape of New York.\n\nBadillo described MacLaughlin as an individual who worked long and diligently to democratize the Democratic Party and to improve the political process and who was motivated by the highest ideals of public service. She served her Community Planning Board 14 as an adviser and representative of the Bronx Borough President. Prior to joining Badillo’s campaign staff in 1965, MacLaughlin had been a member of the executive committee of the FDR-Woodrow Wilson Reform Democratic Club. She worked as a professional staff member on several campaigns for reform candidates.\n\nRuth MacLaughlin Playground, located on Greystone Avenue north of 238th Street, was acquired by the city in 1953. It was used as a play center at one time but fell into neglect. After efforts to develop a vest-pocket park had been stalled for nearly a decade, MacLaughlin intervened to establish a proper public space for the enjoyment of the community. She died on July 25, 1968. The following year, the playground was named by the City Council in her honor.\n\nIn 1996 the park was renovated with city funds allocated by the City Council. The original play structure was dismantled and the playground remodeled with the addition of new play equipment, safety surfacing, fencing, benches, stairs and game tables.\n\n	2016-08-25 17:40:17.71941	\N	f	t	1

She was an active member of the National Association of Colored Graduate Nurses.\nA longtime advocate of woman suffrage, Mahoney is believed to be one of the first women to register and vote in Boston following passage of the 19th Amendment.

The result was a tremendously popular and influential book, Coming of Age in Samoa. Adolescence, she argued, is not inevitably a time of stress and conflict. While portraying the free and easy Samoan life, she was critical of American society for shrouding sexuality in secrecy.\nMead went on to a career of brilliant field work. While other anthropologists spent a lifetime studying one primitive tribe, she studied half a dozen.\nIn the 1920s and 30s the Pacific Islands and New Guinea still offered conditions that tested a scholar’s mettle. “The natives are superficially agreeable,” she once wrote home, “but they go in for cannibalism, headhunting, infanticide, incest, avoidance and joking relationships, and biting lice in half with their teeth.” She pushed back the boundaries of her science, and her clear style of writing and public speaking brought advanced ideas to the general public.\n	2016-08-25 17:40:18.119807	\N	f	t	1	https://www.womenofthehall.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/margaret-mead-150x150.jpg

Victoria continued her education by using the library of her employer, special studies and other opportunities to improve herself. \n\nVictoria Matthews began her journalistic career shortly afterwards, working as a reporter for three New York newspapers, the Times, Herald and Sunday Mercury, and African American newspapers such as the Boston Advocate and the New York Globe.  Her writing and community service were designed to find ways to help African Americans exchange their inner anguish, a possible result of slavery, into outward accomplishments in literary and civic areas. \n\n\nIn civic areas, Mrs. Matthews founded the Woman’s Loyal Union in 1892.  She was also one of the leaders in supporting the anti-lynching crusade of Ida B. Wells.  In 1895 Matthews helped found the National Federation of Afro-American Women and was later instrumental when this organization and the National Colored Women’s League merged with the National Association of Colored Women (1896).  She served as the first national organizer of the combined group from 1897 to 1899.	2016-08-25 17:40:17.969328	\N	f	t	1	http://docsouth.unc.edu/church/richings/richi414.jpg

464	Barbara	McClintock	1902	1992	https://www.womenofthehall.org/	464	America’s most distinguished cytogeneticist, Barbara McClintock she entered Cornell University in 1919 where she concentrated in plant breeding and botany in the College of Agriculture. Since the Plant Breeding department discouraged women from doing graduate work due to a lack of job prospects, she instead studied plant cytology, genetics and zoology in the Department of Botany and received her Ph.D. in 1927.\nShe worked at Cornell and the University of Missouri until 1942, when she secured a research position with The Carnegie Institution of Washington’s Department of Genetics at Cold Spring Harbor, New York. For the next 43 years, Dr. McClintock studied genetic mutations by examining changes in color and texture of the pigment in kernels and leaves of growing plants.\nIn 1950, Dr. McClintock first reported in a scientific journal that genetic information could transpose from one chromosome to another. Many scientists assumed that this unorthodox view of genes was peculiar to the corn plant and was not universally applicable to all organisms. They believed that genes usually were held in place in the chromosome like a necklace of beads.\nTwenty years later, after many discoveries in molecular biology, scientists finally acknowledged Barbara McClintock’s view of genes as universal, and in 1983 she received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for her pioneering discovery of mobile genetic elements. Her work has assisted in the understanding of human disease. “Jumping genes” help explain how bacteria are able to develop resistance to an antibiotic and there is some indication that jumping genes are involved in the transformation of normal cells to cancerous cells.\n	2016-08-25 17:40:18.019824	\N	f	t	1	https://www.womenofthehall.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/barbara-mcclintock-150x150.jpg

466	Katharine Dexter 	McCormick	1875	1967	https://www.womenofthehall.org/	466	Katharine Dexter McCormick made a significant impact on women’s equality in the areas of suffrage, contraception, and scientific education.\nFirst, as an officer of the National Woman’s Suffrage Association, McCormick helped achieve the ratification of the 19th Amendment giving women the right to vote. In 1919, she helped Carrie Chapman Catt found the League of Women Voters. As its first vice president, she educated women in the political process and worked to promote their political power.\nSecond, McCormick funded the essential research that led to the discovery and development of “the pill” (1956). Thereafter, she helped finance research on the pill’s long-term effects.\nFinally, as a rare 1904 female graduate of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), she realized that one of the key barriers to women entering MIT was the lack of campus housing for them. In 1959 she fully funded MIT’s first on-campus residence for women, helping increase the number of women at MIT from 3% to 40% of the undergraduates. As a philanthropist and activist, McCormick significantly improved women’s social, political, economic and intellectual position in America.\n	2016-08-25 17:40:18.053909	\N	f	t	1	https://www.womenofthehall.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/katharine-dexter-mccormick-150x150.jpg

As a feminist and firm believer that women should be able to control their own bodies, McCormick's efforts – primarily in the form of backing research financially – were crucial in the advancement of developing an oral contraceptive. Sadly, American River College history professor Chris Padgett said her contributions are often overlooked.\n \n“Everyone knows Margaret Sanger as a birth control pioneer, but a critical influence on the drive to get the Pill developed was Katharine McCormick, a wealthy heiress and critical backer of the lab research behind the Pill,” he said.                                                                                                                                                                                   	2016-08-25 17:40:18.077114	\N	f	t	1	http://testkitchen.huffingtonpost.com/badass-women/pauline-oliveros/

476	Annie Nathan	Meyer	1867	1951		476	Annie Nathan Meyer was an American author and promoter of higher education for women. Since she was withheld from public school by her mother's request, Meyer was self-educated and claimed to have read all of Dickens' work by the age of seven. Meyer tutored herself in order to enroll in the newly established Columbia College Collegiate Course for Women in 1885. The course did not recognize participants as fully enrolled students, for, at the time, Columbia University did not officially enroll women. She did not attend because she married Alfred Meyer, a prominent physician and a second cousin on February 15, 1887.\nWithin weeks of her wedding, Meyer began organizing a committee to fund a women's college at Columbia in an effort to provide young women the opportunity for an education that she herself had not enjoyed. In January 1888, Meyer wrote a 2,500 word essay to The Nation arguing New York City lacked culture in comparison to other major cities because it lacked a liberal arts college for women. Meyer understood that the idea was nothing without funding. So, working with Ella Weed, she created a committee of fifty prominent New Yorkers willing to support the projected college. Meyer named the college after F. A. P. Barnard, Columbia's recently deceased president and a strong advocate for coeducation. The college Meyer founded, Barnard College, is one of the Seven Sisters and ranks today as one of America's most elite colleges.\nShe later became known as an opponent of woman suffrage, however, once women gained the right to vote in 1920, continued to promote quality education for women so they would make informed political decisions. At one time, Meyer was associate editor of the Broadway Magazine. She edited Woman's Work in America (1891) and contributed a series of articles to the New York Evening Post.\nShe addressed the problem of prejudice and urged African-Americans and Jews to take pride in their heritage\n	2016-08-25 17:40:18.207439	\N	f	t	1	https://scontent-lga3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xpf1/v/t1.0-9/12552917_519501218257185_1689358487864887508_n.jpg?oh=eaf0ef79c5647d0f6ddfec8c9e6cdcef&oe=57B8CE1F

Mikulski graduated with a B.A. from Mount Saint Agnes College (now part of Loyola University Maryland), and an M.S.W. from the University of Maryland School of Social Work in 1965.\n\nDetermined to make a difference in her community, Mikulski first became a social worker in Baltimore.  Her work later evolved into community activism when Mikulski successfully organized communities against a plan to build a sixteen lane highway through Baltimore’s Fells Point neighborhood.\n\nMikulski’s first election effort was a successful run for Baltimore City Council in 1971, where she served for five years. In 1976, she ran for Congress and won, representing Maryland’s 3rd district for 10 years. In 1986, she ran for Senate and won, becoming the first Democratic woman Senator elected in her own right. She was re-elected with large majorities in 1992, 1998 and 2004 and 2010.\n\nDuring her tenure as a United States Senator, Mikulski has developed and supported legislation promoting equal healthcare for American women, Medicare reform, better care for veterans, greater student access to quality education, increased funding for scientific research, and more. Mikulski is the Dean of the Women in the U.S. Senate – mentoring other female Senators when they first take office and building coalitions.  She is also a senior member of the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee; a senior member of the Appropriations Committee; and a member of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence.\n\nSenator Mikulski’s commitment to women is evidenced in her actions and her words. “I don’t want women and their families to be left out and left behind. We can fight for them. We will fight for them. They deserve better and I want to give them better.”\n\nIn 2011, Senator Mikulski officially became the longest serving female Senator in United States history\n	2016-08-25 17:40:18.252478	\N	f	t	1	https://www.womenofthehall.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/barbara-a-mikulski-150x150.jpg

485	Lucy Sprague 	Mithell	1878	1967	http://www.scholastic.com/teachers/article/pioneers-our-field-lucy-sprague-mitchell-teaching-whole-child	485	"We hope to imbue students with an experimental, critical, ardent approach to their work and to the social problems of the world. If we can do this, we are ready to leave the future to them." - Lucy Sprague (1878 - 1967)\nChildren should be seen and not heard. This was a common belief of her time, but one strongly rejected by Lucy Sprague Mitchell. Growing up in a well-to-do family, where children's days were rigidly "scheduled" and expectations of her were high, young Lucy came to feel that she was incapable of pleasing her parents, that she was an in-adequate person. Yet these feelings gave her the impetus to seek new ideas about child rearing and education. Ultimately, she founded a college on those ideas.\nAlthough higher education was still uncommon for young women, Mitchell entered Radcliffe College in 1896. Studying John Dewey's theories, she was especially impressed with his idea of education as a "social function," connecting the child to the experiences of others.\nAfter graduation, and a series of jobs, Mitchell became the first Dean of Women at the University of California at Berkeley. This was at a time when women were beginning to organize at the university, preparing to acquire rights and privileges denied them simply because of their gender.\nWith some clear goals in mind, Mitchell left California for New York in 1913 and started the Bureau of Educational Experiences, which coordinated and sponsored experimental schools around the country and maintained its own nursery school. She promoted the development of healthy, emotionally secure children, "whole children" as she called them, as a way of building toward a "progressive, humanistic society."\nMany curriculum ideas came from Caroline Pratt, whose "Play School" was sponsored by the Bureau. The curriculum was child-centered, promoting the growth of the whole child by focusing on each child's mental, physical, emotional, and social needs. In addition to the school, the community was also seen as the children's learning ground.\nIn October of 1930, Mitchell expanded the Bureau of Educational Experiences to include a teacher training school. The idea for the school was to educate the "whole teacher" in keeping with the philosophy of developing the "whole child." It was vital for the adult to nurture her own growth in order to nurture the growth of a child. When the Bureau relocated to 69 Bank Street, the school became Bank Street College.\nMitchell's early conflicts, which centered on how to grow and change as a female living at the turn of the century, set the stage for the Bank Street model of education. The school became known not only for its contribution to the early education of young children, but for enhancing the development of its faculty, including helping them recognize social problems and their responsibilities to the world at large.\nThis article originally appeared in the April, 2001 issue of Early Childhood Today.\n	2016-08-25 17:40:18.371183	\N	f	t	1	https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ea/Lucy-sprague-mitchell.jpg/220px-Lucy-sprague-mitchell.jpg	https://www.youtube.com/embed/zM3FY_xlZ2Y
490	Maria 'Midy'	Morgan	1828	1892	womensenews.org	490	A smaller building erected at 41 Par row in 1858 was the first built by a New York newspaper, The Times. Expanded twice, it is now the last surviving newspaper building on Park Row itself. In 1869, the Irish-born Maria Morgan got a job here covering the stockyards, race meets, and horse auctions.  She has been identified as the first woman reporter permitted to enter the city room of The Times, and with her great height and stockyard boots, she soon became a striking figure on Newspaper Row. Yet no one dared laugh; even princes prized her advice on horseflesh. Morgan continued at The Times until she died in 1892, having lived long enough to move into the expanded building you see here now. Her obituary in the 1892 Times was long and admiring:\n\nTowering well above the average man, with more than six feet to her credit, and clad in roomy serge, stout shoes showing to the ankles, and a bonnet defiant of wind and rain, she passed along at a swinging gait with more momentum to it than most men would venture to check. But this odd exterior housed qualities of heart and mind which won and kept friends for her and commanded respect and professional success. . . . Miss Morgan was one of the first women to take up daily newspaper work in this city, and was called a pioneer. The designation was deserved in more senses than one, for, while women have followed her, they have not gone into her field. She stood alone in the specialties she cultivated. 	2016-08-25 17:40:18.466392	\N	f	t	1	https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/f8/e5/ac/f8e5acdcde0c7bfdca8124a457fc0f7e.jpg

492	Belle 	Moskowitz	1877	1933		492	Belle Moskowitz, a central figure in Democratic Governor Alfred E. Smith’s “kitchen cabinet,” was born in Harlem, N. Y., the daughter East Prussian immigrants.  After attending city schools and (for a year) Teachers College at Columbia University, in 1900 she became a settlement worker at the Educational Alliance, a Jewish settlement on New York’s Lower East Side.  In 1903, she married Charles Henry Israels, an architect, with whom she raised three children.  She did editorial work for the social reform journal The Survey and volunteered for charitable organizations, focusing on recreational resources for urban working girls.  In 1908, she launched a successful drive to license New York’s commercial dance halls. \n\nCharles Israels died of heart disease in 1911.  To support her children, Belle wrote a pamphlet on child care (The Child) for the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company and worked as “Commercial Recreation Secretary” for the Playground and Recreation Association.  In January 1913 she became grievance clerk for the Dress and Waist Manufacturers’ Association, which fired her in 1916 for being too pro-labor.  \n\nIn 1914, Belle married Henry Moskowitz, a settlement worker, industrial mediator, and then president of the city’s Civil Service Commission.  She opened a public relations firm and worked for woman suffrage.  In 1918, she organized the woman’s vote for “Al” Smith’s campaign for governor and soon was advising him on policy issues.  As Publicity Director for the State Democratic Committee, she counseled Smith on public relations, wrote his speeches, prepared and monitored legislation, and identified appointees for strategic posts.  When in 1926 his fourth gubernatorial victory expanded his national profile, she coordinated a network of supporters that led to Smith’s national Democratic Party nomination in 1928.\n\nDuring this race, as the only woman on the executive committee of the Democratic National Committee, Moskowitz directed the campaign’s publicity.  After his loss to Herbert Hoover, she stayed on as Smith’s press agent, trying (in vain) to retain his party leadership.  In 1932 Franklin Delano Roosevelt defeated Smith for the Democratic nomination and won the presidency.  In December, Moskowitz fell down the steps of her upper West Side brownstone, while recovering from broken bones suffered an embolism, and died.\n\nThe era of Smith’s ascendancy in the national Democratic party was one when women, unless related by blood or marriage to political figures, never achieved such proximity to power.  Moskowitz succeeded by offering Smith a total and selfless loyalty, a strategy that had consequences for Moskowitz’s place in history.  When his career declines, so did hers.  As a result, she remained a generally forgotten figure until the modern women’s history movement revived awareness of her extraordinary career.\n\nElisabeth Israels Perry\nBIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE\n\nMoskowitz’s papers, mostly of a private nature and saved only from the last few years of her life, are at Connecticut College in New London, Conn.  The only complete biography is Elisabeth Israels Perry, Belle Moskowitz: Feminine Politics and the Exercise of Power in the Age of Alfred E. Smith (1987).  For related material, see Mary R.

494	Lucretia	Mott	1793	1880	https://www.womenofthehall.org/	494	The daughter of a sea captain, Lucretia Coffin spent her childhood on Nantucket Island. She was reared in the Quaker faith, unique among American religions in encouraging the equality of women.\nIn 1811 she married James Mott and they made their home in Philadelphia. Soon she began to speak in Quaker meetings, developing confidence and eloquence that were rare at a time when women seldom spoke in public.\nIn the 1830s Mott advocated the radical idea that slavery was sinful and must be abolished. She was one of several American delegates to the 1840 World’s Anti-Slavery Convention in London, but the women were denied seats. There she bonded with Elizabeth Cady Stanton whose husband was a delegate. The lesson was clear for Mott and Stanton. How could women fight for the rights of others unless they enjoyed rights of their own?\nIn 1848, while Mott was visiting her sister in Auburn, New York, she met with Stanton and helped to plan the first woman’s rights convention. Mott delivered the opening and closing addresses at the Seneca Falls Convention, and her husband James chaired the proceedings at the Wesleyan Chapel.\nMotivated by her religious convictions, Mott dedicated herself to the twin causes of antislavery and women’s rights. She harbored runaways slaves in her Philadelphia home and agitated for Negro suffrage and education when emancipation was finally won. As she wrote, spoke, and attended women’s conventions, younger feminists recognized that Mott’s early leadership had been crucial in the infancy of the women’s rights movement.\n	2016-08-25 17:40:18.527717	\N	f	t	1	https://www.womenofthehall.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/lucretia-mott-150x150.jpg

498	Kate	Mullany	1845	1906	https://www.womenofthehall.org/	498	Kate Mullany, a leading female labor organizer in the nineteenth century, worked for justice and opportunities for women in newly emerging industries after the Civil War.\nImmigrating to Troy, New York, from Ireland with her family, Mullany had to go to work in the local laundry at the age of nineteen when her father died. Kate became the primary source of her family’s income. She worked 12 to 14 hours a day, six days a week, for about $3 a week. And if she damaged a shirt or a collar, the company reduced her wages to pay for the damages.\nKate was unwilling to accept the low wages and dangerous, unhealthy working conditions at the laundry. Therefore, only a few months after she went to work in 1864, she founded the Collar Laundry Union, the first bona fide female union in the country. She then led a strike of two hundred laundresses, protesting menial wages and unsafe working conditions. Her efforts led to a twenty-five percent wage increase.\nMullany’s efforts were recognized not only by women workers, but also by male labor organizers. In 1868, she was appointed an assistant secretary of the National Labor Union, making her the first female to hold a national labor position. Later, she led the efforts to form a laundry cooperative as well as a cooperative to manufacture collars and cuffs in order to shift ownership and control to the workers. Due to economic conditions and great pressure from the factory owners, these efforts failed. Still, Mullany remained a prominent labor union leader. As such, she worked to improve the economic lives of countless working-class women, while, during the same era, middle-class women’s suffragists were focused on political rights.\nMullany recognized the connection between the struggle for economic and political rights. With no political power, women laundresses had no ability to pressure leaders to enact needed protective legislation. While Mullany was identified primarily as a workers’ advocate rather than a women’s rights advocate, she worked with suffragists, such as Susan B. Anthony, to further the interests of women wage earners and all trade unionists – male and female.\nAs a labor leader and organizer, Mullany is one of early American labor history’s most important women.\n	2016-08-25 17:40:18.590618	\N	f	t	1	https://www.womenofthehall.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/kate-mullany-150x150.jpg

501	Barbara	Myerhoff	1935	1985	http://jwa.org/people/myerhoff-barbara	501	Barbara Myerhoff was a renowned scholar, heading the University of Southern California's anthropology department in Los Angeles where she lived and raised her family. A creative and extremely popular professor, she urged her students to use the tools of anthropology to question and better understand their own lives and the lives of others. But Myerhoff's influence also reached far beyond academia, and she touched a broad audience with her books and films. Early in her career, Myerhoff participated in Huichol Indian peyote rituals and argued that her controversial choice to involve herself in the culture she was observing gave her insights and access that previous studies of the Huichol culture had missed. Myerhoff's work throughout the 1970's and 1980's shaped the anthropological study of ritual and of life histories. She redefined academic and public perceptions of the elderly and was a pioneer in her scholarship on women and religion. This experience of involvement eventually led her to studying her own culture, interviewing elderly American Jews. It was a groundbreaking choice in a profession where fieldwork traditionally meant exploring distant, indigenous cultures, while those closer to home remained invisible. Myerhoff’s work on Jewish seniors transformed the study of religion. She uncovered women’s traditions and culture running parallel to male traditions, challenging the idea that religious studies meant examining only the texts of the male elite. Beyond its impact on academia, her work helped early Jewish feminists explore and redefine their religious experience. 	2016-08-25 17:40:18.628574	\N	f	t	1	http://jwa.org/sites/jwa.org/files/mediaobjects/bmport5.jpg

There’s no place like it.” But the life of a beginning artist was hard. She said:\n\nIn the toughest economic days, I didn’t have the price to go uptown. The WPA did give me a little breathing space. I only came in at the tail end, in 1937, when it was almost over. You had to go on relief to get on the project, and I didn’t quite want to fill out the papers because my family was helping me at the time but by 1937, I felt it was necessary. So I taught on the project, but I also did painting and sculpture. . . . All my sculpture I had in my first show at Nierendorf in 1941 I did right on the project. I trained myself not to waste. I feel you must know if you’re going to live your life as an artist, you steel yourself daily.

Phenomenal woman is an understatement, I witnessed her go to work every day, never complaining, pregnant and all, I've seen her put in a full day of work, come home take a shower and out the door to go give birth to her child, my sibling, giving us the blueprint of what strength is and how to manage our priorities. Mother always said, "A good name, is better than a bad dollar" and "It's not where you live, but how you live" These are principles I live by today, never judge a book by its cover only. My Mom stands all of 5ft 3in tall, a native of South Carolina, and the youngest sibling of 12 brothers and sisters, who is now survived by her one brother, so the commitment to her family has been the pillar of strength that I have always seen.

514	Antonia	Novello	1944		https://www.womenofthehall.org/	514	The first woman and the first Hispanic to become the Surgeon General of the United States (1990-1993), Antonia Novello brought to her work a strong empathy for people without power in society and used her position to alleviate suffering, especially for women and children.\nTrained as a pediatric nephrologist and in public health, Novello became a clinical professor of pediatrics at Georgetown University Hospital in 1986, after working in private practice and later in the U.S. Public Health Service. In 1987 she was named coordinator for AIDS research at the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development and then Deputy Director.\nAs Surgeon General, Dr. Novello was among the first to recognize the need to focus on women with AIDS and on neonatal transmission of HIV. She found new opportunities for Hispanic/Latino Americans to participate in health issues, convening national and regional meetings to discuss community health needs. She raised national awareness in the medical profession about the domestic violence epidemic in America, and worked to elevate public consciousness about underage drinking and alcohol abuse.\n	2016-08-25 17:40:18.806274	\N	f	t	1	https://www.womenofthehall.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/antonia-novello-150x150.jpg	
515	Sandra Day 	O'Connor	1930		https://www.womenofthehall.org/	515	Sandra Day O’Connor, the first woman named to the U.S. Supreme Court, has made history through her appointment, breaking the ultimate “glass ceiling” in the legal profession.\nNamed to the Court by President Reagan in 1981, O’Connor’s legal beginnings probably did not suggest to her that she would one day hold a seat on the nation’s highest bench. After a distinguished legal preparation at Stanford University (LL.B., 1952), service as a deputy county attorney in California, and work as a civilian lawyer for the Quartermaster Corps while her husband was on military duty in Europe, O’Connor was unable to find work with an Arizona law firm because of her gender. Rather than retreat, she established her own successful law practice — and in 1965 was named assistant attorney general for the State of Arizona. She was named to fill a vacancy in the Arizona State Senate in 1969, and was subsequently re-elected to two, two-year terms, serving as Senate Majority Leader in her last term. In 1975 she was elected to the Maricopa County Superior Court, and then to the Arizona Court of Appeals in 1979.\nThroughout her service on the U.S. Supreme Court, O’Connor has proven to be a thoughtful jurist. She has, forever, shattered the idea that women were not qualified to serve on the nation’s highest court — and by her role model, further opened the door for women at all levels of the legal profession.\n	2016-08-25 17:40:18.82425	\N	f	t	1	https://www.womenofthehall.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/sandra-day-o-connor-150x150.jpg	
518	Georgia	O'Keeffe	1887	1986	https://www.womenofthehall.org/	518	Words do not capture the spare, intense, unforgettable art of Georgia O’Keeffe; her paintings reveal her better, as Alfred Stieglitz said, “a woman on paper.”\nDetermined from her early years to be an artist, O’Keeffe’s career received a boost from famed photographer Alfred Stieglitz, who promoted her paintings in New York City after seeing her work. They married in 1924, beginning one of history’s great creative partnerships. Some of Stieglitz’ best work was of O’Keeffe, his muse, and in turn he promoted and encouraged her art throughout his life.\nGeorgia O’Keeffe was an American original, living as she chose, painting what she wanted. It is said that her art is uniquely American, shining with a bright modernism and energy. The lyrical flowers, the New Mexico-inspired vistas of light and shape, the hard-edged, energetic urban landscapes all somehow could only have been painted by an American woman. O’Keeffe painted all her days, committed as always to what she loved: “Art is a wicked thing. It is what we are.”\n	2016-08-25 17:40:18.861232	\N	f	t	1	https://www.womenofthehall.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/georgia-o-keeffe-150x150.jpg

They toured as a team for some years before he retired to manage her career. She joined Buffalo Bill’s Wild West in 1885 and performed as the star of that 19th century show for more than 16 years. She astonished Americans and royalty across England and Europe with her amazing skill.\nShe was injured in a train accident in 1901 that ended her career with the Wild West. After she recovered she went on to shoot in charity events to help orphans, widows, and underprivileged women. She campaigned for women’s rights to hold paid employment, earn equal pay, participate in sports, and defend herself in her own home and on city streets.\n	2016-08-25 17:40:18.871962	\N	f	t	1	https://www.womenofthehall.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/annie-oakley-150x150.jpg

She and her family would often venture into the woods. From an early age, Patrick admitted to collecting mushrooms, worms, and rocks. She became fascinated with science after receiving her first microscope, at the age of seven. She went on to receive her bachelor’s degree in biology from Coker College in 1929, and completed her masters and doctorate degrees in botany at the University of Virginia.\n\nPatrick’s long career at the Academy of Natural Sciences spanned many years, beginning in 1933 with her position as an unpaid researcher and volunteer curator. She then became curator of the Academy’s Leidy Microscopical Collection and promptly revived the institution’s research in diatoms. Her pioneering work, begun in the 1940s and dubbed The Patrick Principle, became the fundamental principle on which all environmental science and management is based. Patrick proved that biological diversity holds the key to understanding the environmental problems affecting an ecosystem.\n\nIn 1947, Patrick founded the Limnology Department at the Academy of Natural Sciences. She led the department until 1973, and a decade later, it was renamed the Patrick Center of Environmental Research in her honor. She was the first female elected chair of the board of the Academy of Natural Sciences and the first female board member of DuPont. Patrick received the National Medal of Science in 1996 for “her algal research, particularly the ecology and paleoecology of diatoms, and for elucidating the importance of biodiversity of aquatic life in ascertaining the natural condition of rivers and the effects of pollution.”\n\nCalled “a den mother for generations of scientists,” and a “visionary ecologist,” Ruth Patrick was a champion of environmental protection, as well as a mentor and inspiration to future scientists for more than seventy years. Patrick is credited, along with Rachel Carson, as being largely responsible for ushering in the current worldwide concerns with ecology.\n	2016-08-25 17:40:19.069998	\N	f	t	1	https://www.womenofthehall.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/ruth-patrick-150x150.jpg

The boycott lasted 382 days and brought Mrs. Parks, Dr. King, and their cause to the attention of the world. A Supreme Court Decision struck down the Montgomery ordinance under which Mrs. Parks had been fined, and outlawed racial segregation on public transportation. Over the next half-century, Parks became a national symbol of dignity and strength in the struggle to end racial segregation.

She was jailed several times and returned in 1910 determined to put new life into the American woman’s struggle for the ballot. The National American Women Suffrage Association (NAWSA), the old organization of Anthony and Stanton, was still focused on state-by-state campaigns, but Alice Paul preferred to lobby Congress for an amendment to the Constitution.\nShe worked first within the NAWSA and then in her own rival organizations. She soon demonstrated her political savvy, stealing the limelight at Woodrow Wilson’s inauguration with a gigantic suffrage parade. When Wilson proved slow to aid the suffrage cause, Alice Paul adopted the British strategy of holding the party in power responsible. Her group, then called the Congressional Union, campaigned against Democrats in the states where women already voted. Alice Paul led them in militant tactics, including picketing the White House.\nAfter World War I broke out, tensions grew and the pickets were alternately threatened by hostile crowds and thrown in jail. Placed in solitary confinement in a psychopathic ward, Alice Paul was force-fed, but her spirit remained unbroken. In the 1920s her group, by then the National Woman’s Party, set the agenda for feminism: the vote won, the next target would be an Equal Rights Amendment.\n	2016-08-25 17:40:19.112513	\N	f	t	1	https://www.womenofthehall.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/alice-paul-150x150.jpg

She marched on Washington for civil rights and helped create a free clinic for women in our community. She often included my sisters and me in her activist efforts. Whether it was stuffing envelopes for her work as the Director of the Virginia State Office on Volunteerism or asking me to serve on a panel of "non-traditional volunteers when I was 10 years old, she always made volunteering a family activity. She believes very strongly in dignity for the elderly so she organized a group called Friends and Relatives of Nursing Home Residents. She has also worked with the Autism Center, the Jewish Federation, and the African American Institute. My mother does not only volunteer for causes she believes in, but she lives her activist values. I remember her transporting a paraplegic woman in our town to her appointments. I remember her embracing the gay and lesbian community in Richmond, Virginia in the early 70's. I remember her inviting a busload of Australian tourists to our home so they could experience an American family. In 2003 my mother was awarded the YWCA of Richmond, Virginia's Outstanding Women Award for her activism. It was wonderful to see her work recognized by the community. Supposedly my mother retired from her work as Management and Governance Consultant, but she still volunteers with arts and non-profit organizations helping them make their boards of directors stronger. She also shares her values about kindness and dignity with her grandchildren. I am so inspired by the work my mother has done and the life she leads. 	2016-08-25 17:40:19.15423	\N	f	t	1		
537	Mary Engle 	Pennington	1872	1952	https://www.womenofthehall.org/	537	Today’s supermarket refrigerated and frozen food sections are the direct result of the pioneering work of Dr. Mary Engle Pennington. As the population of the United States moved to cities, and people turned to stores and foods shipped long distances instead of backyard home gardens, the 1906 Pure Food and Drug Act was passed to secure the food supply. Dr. Pennington was a trailblazer in implementation of the Act, overseeing the handling, transportation and storage of perishables. She became a leading expert in the evolution of safe and sanitary methods for processing, storing and shipping milk, poultry, eggs, and fish.\nDenied a bachelor’s degree in 1892 because of her sex, Mary Engle Pennington received a certificate of proficiency in chemistry and then went on to earn her PhD in chemistry at the same institution, the University of Pennsylvania, in 1895. She founded the Philadelphia Clinical Laboratory in 1898, joined the U.S. Department of Agriculture in 1905 and became the Chief of its Food Research Lab in 1908. She did bacteriological analyses for subscribing doctors and developed milk and dairy standards, including checklist procedures for dairy herds that were adopted throughout the United States. She traveled the nation investigating the efficiency of refrigerator cars and recommended standards for construction and insulation.\nA recognized authority on refrigeration and its effect on food products, Dr. Mary Engle Pennington spent more than forty years educating the government and the general public in the techniques and importance of proper handling of perishable food. In her later years she oversaw the design and construction of modern refrigerated warehouses, commercial and home refrigerators.\nIn 1923, Pennington was recognized by the American Society of Heating, Refrigeration and Air-conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE), as the foremost American authority on home refrigeration. She was profiled by the New Yorker as “Ice Woman” in 1941, was the first woman elected to the Poultry Historical Society Hall of Fame (1959), and was elected fellow by the American Society of Refrigerating Engineers in 1947.\n	2016-08-25 17:40:19.172327	\N	f	t	1	https://www.womenofthehall.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/mary-engle-pennington.jpg

575	 Emily Warrren	Roebling	1843	1903		575	Emily Warren Roebling had a passion for education at a young age, which was encouraged by her family. She completed her secondary school education, where she excelled in math and science. While visiting her brother in 1864, Roebling met the man she would marry less than a year later – Washington Roebling, son of the renowned engineer, John A. Roebling. In 1869, John A. Roebling, designer of the Brooklyn Bridge, died of tetanus before construction of the bridge began. Washington then succeeds his father as chief engineer and credits his wife with giving him the strength to do so. He wrote, “At first I thought I would succumb but I had a strong tower to lean upon, my wife, a woman of infinite tact and wisest counsel.” In the next few years, he leaned on her even more because caisson’s disease left him severely debilitated.To assist him, Emily took on the role of surrogate chief engineer, which meant studying bridge engineering, conveying instructions to workers, and campaigning for political support when doubts were raised about whether Washington could continue on the project. After 14 years and many setbacks, Emily Warren Roebling became the first person to cross the Brooklyn Bridge on May 17, 1883. At the time, Congressman Abram Hewitt calls it “an everlasting monument to the self-sacrificing devotion of woman and of her capacity for that higher education from which she has been too long disbarred … The name of Mrs. Emily Warren Roebling will thus be inseparably associated with all that is admirable in human nature and all that is wonderful in the constructive world of art.”\n\nIn the years that followed, Emily Roebling would go on to obtain her law degree from New York University at the age of 56.\n\nPhoto taken from the Brooklyn Tower looking toward ‪#‎Manhattan‬, May 25, 1883.	2016-08-25 17:40:19.775477	\N	f	t	1	http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.1083972!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_635/image.jpg	
541	Rebecca Talbot 	Perkins	1866	1956	https://www.womenofthehall.org/	541	Rebecca Talbot Perkins was a highly successful businesswoman who found time during a career of more than fifty years to engage in many philanthropic interests.\nAt the age of twenty-four, following her father’s death from influenza, Perkins assumed leadership of the family’s real estate brokerage. This was at a time when few women were in business and even fewer were running their own enterprises.\nNot long after Perkins established herself in business, she became extremely active in charitable and civic work. In 1893, she joined the Brooklyn Women’s Suffrage Society, a full quarter century before women gained the right to vote. For many years, she served as chair of the Alliance of Women’s Clubs of Brooklyn and served as president of the People’s Political League of Kings County. She was Vice President of the Memorial Hospital for Women and Children, and a director of the Welcome Home for Girls.\nIn 1921, Perkins was asked to find an adoptive family for an out-of-wedlock child. She placed an advertisement in a local paper seeking adoptive parents for the child. The many responses she received encouraged her to continue in this work. In 1927, a time when very few agencies existed to promote adoption, Perkins joined with the Alliance of Women’s Clubs of Brooklyn to create The Rebecca Talbot Perkins Adoption Society. Later know as Talbot Perkins Children’s Services, the organization provided foster care and adoption services to countless families across the country for seventy-five years. She served as the organization’s president from 1927-1949, and honorary president until her death in 1956.\nOver several decades, Perkins fought for causes including better schools, improvements in the courts, increased pay for civil service workers and expanded social services.\n	2016-08-25 17:40:19.245391	\N	f	t	1	https://www.womenofthehall.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/rebecca-talbot-perkins-150x150.jpg

In 1961, she had her pick of positions in the Kennedy Administration and chose to head the Women’s Bureau in the Department of Labor. As Assistant Secretary of Labor, she achieved the creation of the first presidential commission on women, headed initially by Eleanor Roosevelt. This pioneering group for the first time focused federal attention on the status and condition of women in the workplace. Peterson served Presidents Johnson and Carter as adviser in consumer affairs.\nShe continued to work actively in international affairs. On the occasion of her honoring by Radcliffe College, Peterson said, “We have a tremendous responsibility to future generations to leave an accurate record of our history, one which lays bare not only the facts, but the process of change.”\n	2016-08-25 17:40:19.310014	\N	f	t	1	https://www.womenofthehall.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/esther-peterson-150x150.jpg	
540	Frances	Perkins	1880	1965	https://www.womenofthehall.org/	540	From a comfortable background in Worcester, Massachusetts, Frances Perkins went to Mount Holyoke. There lecturers introduced her to the cause of social reform. While teaching in Chicago, she spent her free time at Hull House and she began to move into the new field of social work. She witnessed the Triangle Shirtwaist fire in 1911. That tragedy stiffened her resolve to fight for better conditions for working people, especially women.\nAfter her husband had to be confined to an institution, she proceeded to support herself and raise their young daughter alone. She made conscious compromises to succeed as a career woman, adopting a grandmotherly style of dress she felt was less threatening to men. Perkins was appointed to Governor Al Smith’s administration in Albany, serving on the Industrial Commission and the Bureau of Mediation and Arbitration.\nShe continued to serve after Franklin Roosevelt was elected Governor. When FDR swept into the White House in 1932, he appointed Frances Perkins Secretary of Labor. She was the first woman cabinet officer in American history. After serving throughout Roosevelt’s four terms, she continued to lecture and write, and taught at the Cornell School of Industrial and Labor Relations.\n	2016-08-25 17:40:19.226797	\N	f	f	1	https://www.womenofthehall.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/frances-perkins-150x150.jpg

She was a social worker who was abruptly swept into a life of progressive reform on March 25, 1911. She was having tea in Greenwich Village when fire broke out across Washington Square at 22 Washington Place, the factory of the Triangle Waist Company. Fifty years later, she still recalled:\n\n"We got there just as they started to jump. I shall never forget the frozen horror that came over us as we stood with our hands on our throats watching that horrible sight, knowing that there was no help. They came down in twos and threes, jumping together in a kind of desperate hope. The life nets were broken. The firemen kept shouting for them not to jump. But they had no choice; the flames were right behind them . . . .Out of that terrible episode came a self-examination of stricken conscience in which the people of this state saw for the first time the individual worth and value of those one hundred forty-six people who fell or were burned in that great fire. . . . and we all felt that we had been wrong, that something was wrong with that building, which we had accepted, or the tragedy never would have happened. Moved by a sense of stricken guilt, we banded ourselves together to find a way by law to prevent this kind of disaster." 	2016-08-25 17:40:19.207291	\N	f	f	1	https://www.mtholyoke.edu/sites/default/files/styles/175_women_gallery_feature/public/175/images/perkins_frances.jpg?itok=WEhE7wVp	
545	Judith L.	Pipher	1940		https://www.womenofthehall.org/	545	Dr. Judith L. Piphe, an infrared astronomer, has a career that people at the first women’s rights convention, held in Seneca Falls in 1848, could not even imagine. Her work as an astrophysicist at two acclaimed universities, Cornell University and the University of Rochester, is a significant first among women’s achievements.\nDr. Pipher, a native of Toronto, Ontario, Canada, graduated from the University of Toronto where she majored in astronomy. After graduation, she moved to the Finger Lakes region of New York State, and began graduate study at Cornell University in Ithaca. Along with her part-time study, she taught science classes at the high school and college level. Her doctoral study led her to research in the new field of infrared and submillimeter astronomy. She became the first woman to pursue this brand new research into ultra sensitive light detection of celestial bodies.\nShe received her Ph.D. from Cornell in 1971 and then joined the faculty of the Physics and Astronomy Department at the University of Rochester, where she became the founder of a group of observational infrared astronomers. For the next 31 years she taught full time at the University of Rochester and continued her astronomy research, which included a highly successful and frequently initiated partnership between academic and industrial research groups.\nAs one of the first US astronomers to turn an infrared array camera to the skies, she and her colleagues in 1983 were able to take the first telescopic infrared pictures of starburst galaxies. After her retirement as a full-time professor in 2002, the same year she received the Susan B. Anthony Lifetime Achievement Award, her involvement in infrared technology continued.\nIn 2003 the NASA Spitzer Space Telescope was launched. Dr. Pipher helped design aspects of this telescope which features infrared detector arrays. It is being used to study the distant universe, and clusters of forming stars and brown dwarfs, huge planet-like objects.\nDr. Pipher is a member of numerous astronomical organizations and the author of more than 200 scientific articles and papers. She has chaired or served on a number of national committees that determine astrophysics funding for NASA and the National Science Foundation.\n	2016-08-25 17:40:19.325336	\N	f	t	1	https://www.womenofthehall.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/judith-l-pipher-150x150.jpg

1074	Mitsuye	 Endo		2006		1051	Endo was among the four courageous Japanese Americans who challenged the constitutionality of the military’s policies all the way to the Supreme Court. Indeed, although after the war she apparently never talked about what she had done, her personal sacrifices may have done more than anything else to prompt the end of this regrettable chapter in our history. When the United States declared war on Japan following Pearl Harbor, Endo, a natural-born U.S. citizen, lived in Sacramento and worked for the California Department of Motor Vehicles. In the months after the bombing, the state agency fired her, and military authorities ordered her and her family to evacuate the area in which they lived. The military next required that they report to an assembly center, from which they were sent to be interned at the Tule Lake relocation camp. The government later transferred Endo to another camp in Topaz, Utah. In a petition for a writ of habeas corpus, Endo challenged the internment policy as unconstitutional, correctly arguing that the government had no general authority to detain citizens without criminal charges. Notably, her case posed the first and only direct challenge to the internment camps to reach the Supreme Court. Prior cases had been treated by the court solely as challenges to the curfew, evacuation and registration orders. In an attempt to end her suit, the government offered her release on the condition that she relocate to an area outside the evacuation zones. She refused. Endo knew that if she accepted, her habeas corpus petition would become moot and could not be heard by the courts. In such cases, jurisdiction depends on the government having control over the petitioner. Thus, her release would have eliminated jurisdiction. Her refusal resulted in Endo spending two additional years in the internment camps, deprived of her freedom and forced to live in spartan conditions under armed guard. Endo’s choice could not have been easy. Indeed, it should be viewed as nothing short of heroic. Because she sacrificed her own liberty to keep her case alive, the Supreme Court found itself squarely presented with a challenge to the camps in 1944. As things unfolded, her case played a significant role in persuading the government to change its policies. The court unanimously sided with Endo – albeit in what was ultimately a narrow ruling – and internal court documents suggest that Chief Justice Harlan F. Stone held up the decision to give Roosevelt time to act ahead of the court and suspend Executive Order 9066. Once the military announced that it would begin lifting the evacuation orders and closing the camps, the court handed down the decision Ex parte Endo the very next day, holding that the controlling military orders did not permit the government to detain concededly loyal citizens. The closing of the camps commenced within weeks of the decision, with the last – Tule Lake – closing in 1946.	2016-08-30 15:37:24.518316	\N	f	t	1	http://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2015_29/1121121/mitsuye_endo_national_archives_000618_b5f5d3f32e448b7fde825342dd02fcc8.nbcnews-fp-1200-800.jpg	\N

1075	Susan	B. Anthony	1820	1906		\N	A champion of temperance, abolition and African American rights, the rights of labor, and equal pay for equal work, Susan B. Anthony devoted her life to organizing and leading the woman suffrage movement. Born in Adams, Massachusetts, Anthony was raised in a Quaker family that encouraged women’s education. From an early age, Anthony made her life's work one of justice and sought to establish equality in the larger world. At age 26 Anthony began working as a teacher. Over the next 15 years, Anthony would not only teach, but advocate for equal pay between male and female teachers and equal access to education regardless of race or gender. She continued her call for equal pay, and in 1870 Anthony helped form and was elected president of the Workingwomen’s Central Association. This organization evaluated working conditions and created educational opportunities for working women. Anthony was also active in the anti-slavery movement, working as an agent for the American Anti-Slavery Society, often making speeches for the cause. Anthony helped organize a Women’s National Loyal League in support of the Thirteenth Amendment in 1863. Anthony became involved in the temperance movement in the late 1840s. In 1848, she made her first public speech at a Daughters of Temperance supper. The following year, Anthony was elected president of the Rochester branch of the organization. When the Sons of Temperance in Albany refused to let Anthony speak at their 1853 state convention, she called her own meeting.  Anthony also co-founded the Women’s State Temperance Society. The organization created a petition that called for a law that would limit the sale of liquor. However, the New York State Legislature would not accept the petition since the majority of the signatures were from women or children. Anthony realized that women needed the right to vote so their signatures would be accepted on petitions. A skilled political strategist, Anthony was a leader of the woman suffrage movement and, after meeting Stanton in 1851, their partnership dominated the movement for over 50 years. Anthony was a founding member of the American Equal Rights Association which pushed for a constitutional amendment for suffrage.  She and Stanton opposed the 14th and 15th amendments for not enfranchising women. Anthony published The Revolution, a radical paper that often called for equality between men and women. The paper’s masthead was "Men their rights, and nothing more; women, their rights, and nothing less.” When the suffrage movement split in 1869 Anthony helped found the National Woman Suffrage Association, which continued lobbying for a constitutional amendment. During the 1870s Anthony campaigned for suffrage in the western part of the United States. Anthony was then arrested in 1872 for voting, was tried and convicted. She led a woman’s protest at the 1876 Centennial delivering a "Declaration of Rights" written by Stanton and Matilda Gage. Anthony, Stanton, Gage, and Ida Harper also wrote and published the History of Woman Suffrage. In the late 1880s, Anthony laid the groundwork for the unification of the National Woman Suffrage Association and the American Woman Suffrage Association. Anthony then served as the vice president of the unified National American Woman Suffrage Association from 1890 to 1892, and as president from 1892 to 1900.  Anthony gathered signatures on suffrage petitions at the state and national levels, undertook arduous state tours to organize suffrage campaigns in the states and nationally.  She also worked to ensure the support of organized labor groups. Called “The Napoleon of the woman’s rights movement,” Anthony lobbied yearly before Congress.  She was active in international suffrage circles, and personally raised money to ensure admission of women to the University of Rochester in 1900.  Anthony remained active in the woman's movement until her death, 14 years before women received the right to vote.	2016-08-30 15:59:02.235878	\N	f	t	1	https://ci3.googleusercontent.com/proxy/kbH6NIzFVrvUd5KgR1sta7tA9bmCV7lE4axAQNRlYunk_YPILWetrd1G1aABFMEiW4KwlSy4Qk7RK5RCGxZE8fDVDHM89ABFDDgrJbhfLxikPEhvGBrwIAE47d63t6jCQ2LD3wZi=s0-d-e1-ft#https://www.nwhm.org/media/category/education/biography/biographies/santhony.jpg	\N
1076	Abigail	Scott Duniway	1834	1915		1052	When she was seventeen years old, her life changed dramatically with the death of her mother and brother during the family's grueling trek to Oregon in an ox-drawn cart. Abigail's family settled in Lafayette, Oregon, where she began a career as a schoolteacher. Just one year later, she married Benjamin C. Duniway. Four children promptly followed, spaced less than two years apart. By 1859, while Duniway filled her days caring for children and farm chores, she found time in the late evenings to pen her first novel, Captain Gray's Company. Her writing skills literally kept the family afloat when Benjamin suffered a crippling accident and lost the farm. Abigail was now the breadwinner and returned to teaching as well as running a hat shop in Albany, Oregon. A move to Portland in 1871 offered the family a new start.\r\nThe women's rights movement was small but active in Portland, and Duniway decided that a women's newspaper would offer income as well as a valuable outlet for her writing talents. She founded the New Northwest during her first year in Portland, after an inspiring visit from national suffrage leader Susan B. Anthony. Politics, fiction, fashion, and domestic advice filled the pages of the popular new publication, which Duniway edited for the next sixteen years. She found time to lecture on temperance and women's rights as well, and was active in the Portland Women's Club. Duniway's reputation grew throughout the entire region, with speaking engagements pouring in as far away as Idaho City, Boise, and Lewiston, Washington. National suffrage leaders called on her to serve as a vice president in the National Women's Suffrage Association in 1884. Lecture tours and publication of New Northwest kept Duniway in a constant whirlwind of activity...Traveling some 12,000 miles and giving more than 140 lectures, Duniway turned her full attention to the Idaho campaign. With local women taking charge, Duniway led the suffrage referendum campaign in Idaho to victory in 1896. She helped mastermind the campaign to victory in Washington State as well in 1910.\r\nDuniway's efforts to win the right to vote in her home state of Oregon proved much more demanding. From 1884 to 1910, Oregon's male voters defeated suffrage five times at the polls. Ironically, Duniway's own brother, the influential publisher of the Oregonian, editorialized against every suffrage measure. Finally, in 1911, Duniway and her forces mustered the courage to take the issue before the intransigent voters one last time. She led the Oregon Equal Suffrage Association to victory at the polls in 1912. On November 30, 1912, Duniway signed Oregon's suffrage proclamation and became the first woman in her state to register to vote. Her autobiography, Pathbreaking, remains a powerful memoir of her forty years of service to women's rights.	2016-08-30 16:06:06.703825	\N	f	t	1	https://oregonencyclopedia.org/media/uploads/Duniway_Abigail_Scott.JPG	\N

Piven’s professional accomplishments in the world of academia place her among the ranks of the most important social scientists of the last century.  Her groundbreaking work with Richard A. Cloward on the functions of social welfare and poor relief (Regulating the Poor, 1971) received front page coverage in the New York Times Book Review and ignited a scholarly debate that reshaped the field of social welfare policy. Piven is the author or co-author of more than 200 articles published in academic journals, books, popular publications and journals of opinion since 1965, some of which have been republished up to a dozen times.   \nProfessor Piven loves teaching at the Graduate Center, where she has found a home for more than three decades.  In addition, she has held visiting professorships and fellowships (including Fulbright and Guggenheim awards) at numerous universities here and abroad, such as the Institute for Advanced Studies in Vienna, the University of Amsterdam, Hebrew University, and the University of Bologna, and at the University of Iowa, the University of Wisconsin, the University of California, Arizona State University, the University of Oregon and at Smith College.  Her service to the profession runs equally far and wide, and is most prominently noted by her election as a recent president of the American Sociological Association (2007), as President of the Society for the Study of the Social Problems (1980), and as a Vice President of the American Political Science Association (1981).\n \nIt is not only Professor Piven’s academic work that marks her career for distinction.  Rather, it is the unique and exemplary ways that she has bridged the worlds of academia and social activism to advance humanizing social policy reform that sets her apart.  And at this she has been remarkably successful, beginning in the late 1960s, when, along with George Wiley and others, Professor Piven was a founder of the National Welfare Rights Organization (NWRO).  Later, in 1982, Professor Piven was a co-founder of the Human Service Employees Registration and Voter Education Campaign, or Human SERVE, which pioneered the idea of “automatic voter registration,” whereby citizens would be registered to vote when they applied for social assistance or drivers’ licenses.  After a decade of advocacy and organizing, Human SERVE’s program was incorporated into the National Voter Registration Act of 1993, popularly known as the “motor voter” bill.  This legislation represented an historic advance in the struggle to win full enfranchisement for low-income and minority people.                                                                                                                                              Piven’s grassroots activism continues to this day.  She currently serves on the boards of numerous nonprofit and advocacy groups like Project Vote and Wellstone Action, and generously shares her knowledge and funds raised through speaking fees with anti-poverty groups like Community Voices Heard, FUREE, the Center for Community Change, and many others.  Piven’s community service has been recognized throughout her career.

A committed pacifist, Rankin was the only member of Congress to oppose entry of the United States into both World Wars.\nRankin was active in the woman suffrage movement in the West, and campaigned for election to Congress after her state gave women the right to vote. In Congress she sponsored legislation to provide federal voting rights and health services to women. Her anti-war vote in 1917 cost her her office, and she devoted much of the remainder of her life to pacifist causes.\nShe held leadership roles in the Women’s Inter-national League for Peace and Freedom and other groups. In 1940 she ran again for Congress on an isolationist platform and in 1941 was the sole Member to oppose the declaration of war on Japan.\nShe later traveled extensively, studying with Ghandi, among others.

560	Janet	Reno	1983		https://www.womenofthehall.org/	560	Janet Reno, the first female Attorney General of the United States, has had a life filled with “firsts.” Reno graduated from Cornell University in 1960 with a degree in chemistry, having worked her way through school as a waitress and dormitory supervisor. She then earned her law degree from Harvard Law School in 1963, one of sixteen women in a class of more than 500. She eventually became a partner in a law firm that had previously denied her a position because she was a woman.\nHer first entry into government work was in 1971 as staff director of the Judiciary Committee of the Florida House of Representatives, where she helped revise the Florida court system. In 1978, she became the first woman to head a county prosecutor’s office in Florida. As Dade County State Attorney, Reno was the first Florida prosecutor to assign lawyers to collect child-support payments from deadbeat fathers. Winning election for four terms as a Democrat in the heavily conservative, Republican Dade County, Reno helped establish the Miami Drug Court, which has served as a model for other courts, helped reform the juvenile justice system, and focused attention on needed prevention programs for children.\nAppointed United States Attorney General by President Clinton in 1993, Reno worked to reduce crime and violence; to enhance prevention and early intervention efforts to keep children away from gangs, drugs, and violence; to enforce civil rights to ensure equal opportunities for all; to prosecute violations of ecological statutes; and to build a Justice Department that strives for excellence and professionalism. She faced many controversial decisions, including the confrontation with the Branch Davidian religious cult in Waco, Texas. Despite some attacks on Reno for this action, Reno won respect from average Americans by unflinchingly taking responsibility for the operation. Similarly, Reno made the difficult decision to raid the home of Elian Gonzalez’s relatives so the six-year old Cuban could be returned to his father’s custody. Again, some tried to second-guess Reno’s decision, but she remained firm.\nReno’s childhood taught her to strive for excellence as well as stand for absolute honesty. Her father was a crusading reporter for the Miami Herald while her mother, also a journalist, built the family’s home and was known to wrestle alligators. Significantly, her mother influenced her with this homily: “Good, better, best. Don’t ever rest until good is better and better is best.\n\n	2016-08-25 17:40:19.567123	\N	f	t	1	https://www.womenofthehall.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/janet-reno-205x258.jpg

566	Leda 	Richberg-Hornsby 	1887	1939	http://www.nyhistory.org/	566	Let’s focus on an attempted publicity stunt from 1916 involving New York suffragists, a biplane, and President Woodrow Wilson. Three fantastic photographs in the library collection tell the beginning of the story as a group of suffragists met at Midland Beach, Staten Island on December 2, 1916.\nThe plan was to “bomb” President Woodrow Wilson on his yacht, the Mayflower, as it made its way down the Hudson River en route to the illumination of the Statue of Liberty. This “bomb” consisted of yellow petitions from “woman voters of the West” and leaflets in support of the Susan B. Anthony suffrage amendment. Written by Anthony (1820-1906) with the assistance of Elizabeth Cady Stanton (1815-1902), this amendment called for the extension of the right to vote to women. First presented to Congress in 1878, by 1916 it had been rejected by the Senate twice, and had recently been defeated in the House of Representatives in January 1915. Not until 192\nThe pilot of this intrepid suffrage plane was Leda Richberg-Hornsby (1887-1939) of Chicago, described by the New York Sun as “petite, plucky, brunette, holding in her hand the all-around aviator’s license she won a month ago which entitles her to fly as a Lieutenant in the Government’s service in case of war.” She was only the eighth woman in the United States to earn a pilot’s license, and the first female graduate of the Wright Flying School in Dayton. The original choice for pilot was Ruth Law (1887-1970), who unfortunately was unavailable due to her involvement with the illumination ceremony – circling the Statue of Liberty in an illuminated plane with Liberty written on the bottom. A suffragist herself, Richberg-Hornsby volunteered in Law’s place, stating: “This is war for woman’s rights. I am proud to fly for you.”Joining Richberg-Hornsby in the two-seater biplane that day was Ida Blair (1874-1930), a business woman, welfare worker, and suffrage leader, who had previously participated in other suffrage stunts during the 1915 Empire State campaign. The plane was adorned with a large banner reading “Women Want Liberty Too,” which can be partially seen in the first photo. (The message is also written on the photo in the sky above the plane.) Cheered on by their fellow members of the New York branch of the National American Woman Suffrage Association, Richberg-Hornsby and Blair took off around 5:45pm on their bombing mission. Unfortunately, the weather was not on their side.\nAlthough airborne for nearly a mile, the high winds that day (described by the New York Sun as “virtually a gale”) forced Richberg-Hornsby to crash land the plane in a Staten Island swamp. Neither woman was seriously injured from the adventure, nursing only a “few mundane bumps,” but were disappointed not to succeed in their attempt to demonstrate the fervor of their convictions. One thing is sure. Regardless of the outcome, they were committed to their cause, as were the hundreds and thousands of other women who fought so long and hard in the late 19th and early 20th century for the right to vote. Cheers to you, ladies.\nWritten by Maureen Maryanski, Reference Librarian for Printed Collections.\n	2016-08-25 17:40:19.642883	\N	f	t	1	http://blog.nyhistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/sufferage002-785x1024.jpg	
567	Sally	Ride	1951	2012	https://www.womenofthehall.org/	567	In 1983, twenty-two years after the first United States manned space mission, Sally Ride became the first American woman in space. She was a mission specialist on the Challenger, the seventh space shuttle flight.\nRide had applied to be an astronaut in 1977 after seeing an announcement that NASA was looking for young scientists to serve as mission specialists on its shuttle flights. Previous astronauts had been military test pilots, but NASA was looking for scientists and technicians who could monitor the complex technology of the shuttle. Eight thousand people responded to the announcement, one thousand of them women. Six women, among them Sally Ride, were selected for a group of 35 new astronauts in 1978.\nBecoming an astronaut had not been a lifelong goal for Ride. A talented athlete, she had considered a professional tennis career, but decided against it because, her mother says, she could not make the ball go exactly where she wanted it. Instead, she enrolled at Stanford University, graduating in 1973 with degrees in physics and English. She continued her studies in physics, earning a Ph.D. in astrophysics shortly before joining NASA.\nAs a mission specialist on the six-day Challenger mission, her responsibilities included testing a robot arm which deployed and retrieved satellites, assisting the commander and shuttle pilot during ascent, re-entry, and landing, and acting as flight engineer. She said of that flight, “The thing that I’ll remember most about the flight is that it was fun. In fact, I’m sure it was the most fun I’ll ever have in my life.” Ride flew into space again in 1984. In 1986, she was part of the presidential commission investigating the Challenger explosion.\nIn 1987, she left NASA to accept a fellowship at the Stanford University Center for International Security and Arms Control. In 2001, Ride founded Sally Ride Science, an innovative science content company dedicated to supporting girls’ and boys’ interests in science, math and technology. Ride served as the organization’s President & CEO.\n\n	2016-08-25 17:40:19.654845	\N	f	t	1	https://www.womenofthehall.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/sally-ride-150x150.jpg	
568	Rozanne L.	Ridgway	1935		https://www.womenofthehall.org/	568	Ambassador Rozanne L. Ridgway served over three decades as an American foreign policy leader. Her expertise as an international negotiator was demonstrated in complex multilateral and bilateral agreements that she negotiated on behalf of the U.S.\nIn the early 1970s, Ridgway skillfully negotiated longstanding issues over fishing rights in Brazil, Peru and the Bahamas. This led to her appointment in 1976 as the Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Oceans and Fisheries. During her tenure, she negotiated the 200-mile fishing rights treaty. Ridgway’s subsequent negotiations led to the return of property of U.S. citizens from Czechoslovakia, an arrangement that will provide the basis for similar negotiations with Cuba when relations are normalized. Her success dealing with these issues — a complicated mix of domestic politics, economics, foreign policy and international security issues — prepared her for substantial contribution at the highest level of our government.\nAs Special Assistant to the Secretary of State for Negotiations and, subsequently, the Assistant Secretary of State for Europe and Canada, she was the lead negotiator at all five Reagan/Gorbachev summits. These brought the first substantive reductions in nuclear weapons, signaled the beginning of the end of Communism and the Cold War, and established the fundamental realignment of global power as America prepared to enter the 21st century.\nBetween Ridgway’s positions at the Department of State, she served as America’s Ambassador to Finland from 1977 to 1980 and as the Ambassador to the German Democratic Republic between 1983 and 1985. She retired as Assistant Secretary of State for European and Canadian Affairs and sits on corporate boards.\n\n	2016-08-25 17:40:19.66926	\N	f	t	1	https://www.womenofthehall.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/rozanne-l-ridgway-150x150.jpg

576	Mother Mary Joseph 	Rogers	1882	1955	https://www.womenofthehall.org/	576	A woman of extraordinary vision and drive, Mother Mary Joseph Rogers, MM, founded the Maryknoll Sisters, the first U.S.-based Catholic congregation of religious women dedicated to a global mission.\nWhile studying zoology at Smith, Rogers became inspired by graduating Protestant students who were soon leaving for missionary work in China.  Following her graduation, she worked as an assistant in the Biology Department for two years and then taught in Boston’s public schools.  Shortly thereafter, Rogers returned to Smith and started a mission club for Catholic students.  While organizing the club, she met Father James A. Walsh, director of Boston’s Office for the Propagation of the Faith.  Father Walsh was launching a mission magazine in which Rogers took immediate interest and volunteered her time to assist with production.\nNearly a decade later, Father Walsh co-founded Maryknoll Fathers & Brothers, and Rogers was selected as one of the “secretaries” to direct the group under his guidance.  Rogers took the religious name Mother Mary Joseph and oversaw the growth of the congregation and its expansion into mission.  In 1920, the group became recognized as the Maryknoll Sisters, a mission society of women that ministers to the humanitarian needs of all people, especially the poor, regardless of race, creed or color.  While leading the mission, Mother Mary Joseph welcomed women from all nations, stressed the need for sisters to be compassionate women, and took care to integrate prayer with apostolic ministry.\nMother Mary Joseph was awarded honorary doctorates from Smith College, Trinity University and Regis College, Boston.  By the time of her death in 1955, there were 1,065 sisters working in twenty countries and several cities in the United States.  The Maryknoll Sisters became a Pontifical Institute in 1954 and the name of the Congregation was changed to Maryknoll Sisters of St. Dominic.\n\n	2016-08-25 17:40:19.792681	\N	f	t	1	https://www.womenofthehall.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/mother-mary-joseph-rogers-mm-150x150.jpg

This background made her an outstanding legislator, beginning in 1925 when she was elected to the 69th Congress to complete her late husband’s unfinished term. Going on to win 17 more elections, she became the longest-serving woman in the history of the House of Representatives.\nAmong her highest achievements was drafting a major portion of the G.I. Bill of Rights. It gave returning World War II veterans opportunities to go to college, obtain job training, and get low interest mortgages.\nEven more visionary was her introduction of legislation, at the start of World War II, to establish the Women’s Army Auxiliary Corps (WAAC). This allowed women to serve in the armed forces. Now women are important to all branches of the military. Rogers also fought against child labor, supported the 48-hour work week for women, and backed equal pay for equal work.\n	2016-08-25 17:40:19.815707	\N	f	t	1	https://www.womenofthehall.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/edith-nourse-rogers-150x150.jpg	
578	Begum	Rokeya				578	Rokeya Sakhawat Hossain was a Muslim feminist and social reformer who dedicated her life to education and the empowerment of women. Born in 1880 in Bangladesh during British colonial rule, Rokeya was brought up in a Muslim family that followed the purdah, a strict set of social rules which required women be secluded from society. However, the support from her brothers and husband would give her the strength to persevere through harsh criticism, and inspire her to become the author of several books and eventually open a school for girls.\n\nRokeya’s father was a rich landowner who had the means to educate his two sons Abul Asad Ibrahim Saber and Khalil Saber. Unfortunately Rokeya’s father had little interest in educating any of his daughters.  Her brothers, inspired by their Western education, secretly taught Rokeya and her sister Bengali and English. However, before the age of 15, Rokeya’s sister would be forced into a child marriage. This would have a strong impact on Rokeya. In one of her personal essays she states “Had society not been so suppressive, Karimunessa would have been a bright gem of this country, as the glow of an electric bulb is dimmed by a thick cover, so the lady described by me could not show her gifts due to the covers of purdah”.\n\nIn 1898, Rokeya married Syed Sakhawat Hossain a civil servant who firmly believed that the education of women would cure society of its evils. Hossain would prove to be a supportive husband and encouraged Rokeya’s writings and activities and he set aside money so she would be able to start a school for Muslim women.  In 1905 she wrote and published Sultana’s Dream, which became one of the highest regarded literary works in Bangladesh. After her husband died in 1909, Rokeya wrote, “If my dear husband had not been so supportive I might never have written or published anything.”  That same year she opened the first school in Bengal for Muslim girls with only five students.  Although she was forced to close the school in 1910 and reopen it in Calcutta in 1911, the number of students grew to 84 by 1915; the Sakhawat Memorial Girl’s School still exists today.\n\nIn 1916, she founded the Muslim Women’s Association, an organization that argued for women’s education and employment.  In 1926, Rokeya presided over the Bengal Women’s Education Conference held in Calcutta, the first noted attempt to bring women together in support of women’s education rights. She was active in debates and conferences concerning the advancement of women until her death on December 9, 1932, shortly after presiding over a session during the Indian Women’s Conference.\n\nEvery year December 9th is observed as “Rokeya Day” in Bangladesh.  Today, she is remembered for her ability to escape the restriction of the purdah and for using her skills as a writer to voice insightful and witty opinions. She holds high recognition as being one of the first Muslim feminists that attempted to bring major social changes to her country.  Through her actions she earned the honorific title of begum which is only given to women who earn the right to a higher status.\n\nIn 2001, Fauzia Karim, the great niece of Rokeya Sakhawat Hossain donated several items to the Florence Bayard Hilles Feminist Library including a copy of Sultana’s Dream and some of her other short writings, an original commemorative stamp in honor of Hossain, and a book entitled Inside Seclusion: The Avarodhbasini of Rekeya Sakhawat Hossain edited and translated by Roushan Jahan.  Following this donation, in 2011 Fauzia Karim commissioned a small bust of Hossain, jointly funded by Fauzia Karim, family and friends, which was completed by artist Mekbib Gebertsadik.	2016-08-25 17:40:19.839588	\N	f	t	1	https://www.worldpulse.com/sites/default/files/post/1775/3295/post_image_gallery/7fdbb08d7e81bc9ed0958092a60ca1b0/begum_rokeya.jpg	
579	Eleanor	Roosevelt	1884	1962	https://www.womenofthehall.org/	579	As a child, Eleanor Roosevelt was made to feel that she was an “ugly duckling.” After losing both her parents, she was raised by her stern and proper grandmother, and her loneliness persisted until she was befriended by the headmistress at her boarding school. She “came out” into society, but preferred volunteer work at a settlement house to the social whirl. In 1905 she married her cousin, Franklin Roosevelt, a marriage made more complex by her domineering mother-in-law, Sara. While raising six children, Eleanor Roosevelt gradually found the determination to abandon traditional roles in favor of political and reform work.\nShe joined the League of Women Voters, worked with trade union women, and pressed for women’s causes within the Democratic Party. After Franklin Roosevelt was paralyzed by polio in 1921, her public activities expanded. She became his political representative, especially after he was elected governor of New York State in 1928. After her husband’s landslide election in 1932, she feared the White House might encase her in sterile protocol. But her broad sympathies and great energy created a whole new image of what a First Lady could be.\nEleanor Roosevelt held her own press conferences, toured the nation repeatedly, and pressed her opinions through newspaper columns and radio broadcasts. In the dark days of the Depression she made Americans feel that someone cared and would try to help. Even though Franklin Roosevelt did not always follow her advice, she pressed the cause of Black people, youth, the poor, and the unemployed.\nAfter her husband’s death in 1945, President Truman named her U.S. Delegate to the United Nations. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, adopted in 1948, was largely her work, and the delegates rose in a standing ovation for her. Eleanor Roosevelt continued to be active in politics and in work for international cooperation. At a memorial service, Adlai Stevenson said: “She would rather light candles than curse the darkness, and her glow warmed the world.”\n\n	2016-08-25 17:40:19.851664	\N	f	t	1	https://www.womenofthehall.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/eleanor-roosevelt-150x150.jpg

She became an activist for higher wages and better working conditions for her fellow laborers. She is credited with coining the phrase “bread and roses” to explain that women workers needed “both economic sustenance and personal dignity,” according to Hasia Diner, a professor of American Jewish history at New York University.\n \n“Schneiderman, who died in 1972, demonstrated the dedication of women to the labor movement, something that most male labor leaders denied,” Diner said.               	2016-08-25 17:40:20.429746	\N	f	f	1	http://testkitchen.huffingtonpost.com/badass-women/rose-schneiderman/	
582	Ernestine	Rose	1810	1892	https://www.womenofthehall.org/	582	Ernestine Rose, often cited by Susan B. Anthony as one of the early influential leaders of the women’s suffrage movement was born in a ghetto in Russian Poland. She inherited substantial property at the death of her mother. As was the custom, her father assigned Rose and her dowry in marriage to a man his age, although her refusal to consent to the marriage was quite controversial.\nInstead, Rose successfully persuaded Polish officials to grant her authority over her inheritance. In 1827, she left Poland, traveled across Europe, and married William Rose. The couple emigrated to the United States in 1836.\nSettling in New York, she took up the cause of the married women’s property bill that had been introduced in the State Legislature. In 1840, along with Paulina Wright Davis and Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Rose circulated petitions and spoke in support of the bill before a legislative committee in Albany. Because of strong opposition, twelve years elapsed before a limited version of the bill passed both houses of the Legislature.\nDuring the 1850’s, Rose focused her efforts on women’s rights. In 1850, she attended the first national women’s rights convention in Worcester, Massachusetts, where she introduced a resolution calling for “political, legal and social equality with man.” For the next 20 years, she attended most national and state conventions and was frequently a recognized speaker. She lectured in more than twenty states, addressing legislative bodies on the issues of antislavery, temperance and freedom of thought, as well as women’s rights. Her oratorical prowess led to her title, “Queen of the Platform.”\nDuring the Civil War, Rose found herself again in the company of Stanton as they worked together in the Women’s Loyal National League and later in the American Equal Rights Association. In 1869, the pair, along with Susan B. Anthony, took the lead in transforming the Equal Rights Association into the National Women’s Suffrage Association, an organization critical to the success of the women’s suffrage movement in 1920.\n \n	2016-08-25 17:40:19.904537	\N	f	t	1	https://www.womenofthehall.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/ernestine-louise-potowski-rose-150x150.jpg

In 1980 she became founder and executive director of Providence House, Inc., affiliated with Catholic Charities, which includes multiple sites offering shelter for battered women and families, homeless women, temporary housing for women released from prison, and more. In the same year Roulet founded and became director of the Children’s Center at Bedford Hills, which includes a parenting center, children’s playroom, nursery and infant center. She has created support programs for mothers and their babies in prison, where this unique program permits mothers whose babies are born in prison to keep them for as long as one year. The Bedford Hills program has become a national model for prisons, overturning conventional wisdom about prisons, women and their children. Roulet says, “Some people say that babies shouldn’t be in prison. The baby doesn’t know he is prison, but he does know that he’s with his mother.”\n\n	2016-08-25 17:40:19.936566	\N	f	t	1	https://www.womenofthehall.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/elaine-roulet-150x150.jpg

By age 16, she was an All-State basketball player and a bronze medalist in the 1956 Olympics. She attended Tennessee State University on a track scholarship, and returned for the 1960 Olympics – and Olympic glory, winning gold medals in the 100 meter dash, 200 meter dash and the 4 x 100 meter relay.

She also served on the Board of the Massachusetts Moral Education Association and the Massachusetts School Suffrage Association, working closely with other New England women leaders, including Julia Ward Howe and Lucy Stone. Her particular interest was the development of African-American women in New England and nationwide, and in 1894 she organized the Women’s Era Club, among the very first African-American women’s organizations. In 1895, she convened in Boston a conference of representatives of other national groups, which organized the National Federation of Afro-American Women. Its mission was to demonstrate the existence of a large number of educated, cultured African-American women. At its founding meeting she said, “…we are women, American women, as intensely interested in all that pertains to us as such as all other American women; we are not alienating or withdrawing, we are only coming to the front, willing to join any others in the same work and welcoming any others to join us.” In 1896 this group merged with the Colored Women’s League of Washington, forming the National Association of Colored Women; Ruffin was elected first vice-president. Continued resistance of all-white national women’s clubs reinforced her commitment to the importance of the African-American clubwomen’s movement, and she remained an active participant throughout her life.\nRuffin was also active in the founding of the Boston branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, and of the League of Women for Community Service.\n\n	2016-08-25 17:40:19.991649	\N	f	t	1	https://www.womenofthehall.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/josephine-st-pierre-ruffin-150x150.jpg	
589	Mary Harriman 	Rumsey	1881	1934	https://www.womenofthehall.org/	589	The founder of The Junior League, Mary Harriman Rumsey, was a young woman ahead of her time. The daughter of Union Pacific Railroad titan and financier, E.H. Harriman, she traveled extensively with her father on business trips, family wilderness trips, and scientific expeditions. However, it was while she was enrolled at Barnard College and volunteering at the College Settlement that she became convinced her life of privilege required her to work for social reform. Mary saw an untapped resource in her elite debutante friends: a self-perpetuating supply of volunteers who could enrich their own lives by becoming involved in improving social conditions in their city. In 1901, 80 young women came together in New York City and formed the first Junior League as The Junior League for the Promotion of Settlement Movements.\nBuilding on her idea, Ms. Rumsey and the League’s leaders brought together experts on the Settlement Movement to provide lectures and instruction to Junior League members, thus designing the archetype of a new kind of civic leadership: volunteer-driven social services and policies grounded in education and intense training from subject-area experts. This model allowed knowledgeable volunteers to fill gaps left by government agencies, private corporations, and individual philanthropists. Her legacy can be seen in enacted legislation at various levels of government and the many social service programs that exist in Junior League communities today: domestic violence shelters, children’s museums, mentoring and self-esteem workshops, human trafficking awareness campaigns, support hotlines, advocacy for incarcerated juveniles, literacy programs, food pantries, nutritional and fitness counseling, community gardens, environmental clean-up efforts, education for immigrants. Today, The Junior League is one of the oldest, largest, and most effective women’s volunteer organizations, encompassing more than 150,000 women in 292 Leagues in the United States, Canada, Mexico and the United Kingdom.\nThroughout her life, Ms. Rumsey continued to work tirelessly for social reform. She was appointed by President Franklin D. Roosevelt as the Chair of the first consumer’s rights group, The Consumer Advisory Board of the National Recovery Administration, which is today the Treasury Department’s Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. She helped author the Social Security Act and was instrumental in the creation of public playgrounds in New York’s Central Park, one of which still bears her name.\nMs. Rumsey had a skill for bringing together people who might not otherwise connect. In addition to bringing her debutante friends to the settlement houses, she brought to her dinner table a diverse group of artists, politicians, business leaders, writers and scientists with the idea that working together was the only way to move society forward.\n	2016-08-25 17:40:20.020947	\N	f	t	1	https://www.womenofthehall.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Rumsey-Mary-120x150.jpg	
1077	Esther	Hobart Morris	1812	1902		1053	At age eleven Esther's parents died, leaving her an orphan. A seamstress took her in, where she learned valuable skills as a seamstress and hat maker. As a young, independent businesswoman, Esther joined the anti-slavery movement where she learned about many social injustices facing women under slavery. She married but in 1845 sadly found herself a widow. She moved to Illinois, where she married her new and prosperous husband, John Morris. Like so many Americans, Esther and John caught "gold fever" after the Civil War. They heard about the rich ore deposits in the mining camps of the Rocky Mountains, and so in 1869 they packed up their belongings and moved to the gold camp of South Pass City, Wyoming. Although there were more antelope than people in Wyoming, Esther quickly found a small group of women and men who were interested in politics. Morris's past involvement in the anti-slavery and women's rights movement spurred her to suggest that the new territory of Wyoming could make world history by granting women the right to vote. Legalized women's suffrage would 'prove a great advertisement,' she felt, inducing more women and families to settle in Wyoming. Morris lobbied the twenty-two members of the territorial legislature. In 1869, upon the urging of his wife, Julia, William Bright introduced a suffrage measure to the legislature. Passage of this landmark suffrage law that same year helped make Wyoming famous as the "Equality State." Other laws that passed that year gave married women the right to own property, the right to serve on juries, and equal pay for female teachers. Morris's diligent work on behalf of women in Wyoming Territory earned her an appointment as the first female justice of the peace in South Pass City, the nation, and the world. When Wyoming entered the union as the Equality State in 1890, Morris was honored nationally as a suffrage pioneer. 	2016-08-30 16:09:49.742416	\N	f	t	1	https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bc/Esther_Morris_cph.3a02555.jpg	\N

Hers was the first generation to benefit from the long struggle to open higher education to women. She graduated in early classes at Smith College and Johns Hopkins Medical School.\nUnlike many women pioneering in the professions, she was fortunate to find a sympathetic mentor in her anatomy professor, Franklin Mall. He stimulated her interest in anatomy when the field was just beginning to be experimental rather than merely descriptive. Sabin proved an extremely talented researcher. She won one of four highly prized internships at Johns Hopkins Hospital, and eventually joined the faculty at Johns Hopkins. Dr. Sabin rose to the rank of full professor in 1917, the first woman in the university to achieve that rank.\nShe worked on embryology and did important research on the origins of the lymphatic system. She also brought back from Germany a new technique for non-toxic staining of cells. In 1925 she became the first woman elected to the National Academy of Science. She went on to do research in tuberculosis at the Rockefeller Institute. Although Sabin retired in 1938, in her seventies she took up another highly successful career, as a reforming public health official in her native state of Colorado.\n\n	2016-08-25 17:40:20.080305	\N	f	t	1	https://www.womenofthehall.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/florence-sabin-150x150.jpg

1078	Harriet	Stanton Blatch	1856	1940		1054	Harriot Stanton Blatch, the daughter of Elizabeth Cady Stanton, not only carried on her Mother's Legacy, but became a leader herself in the New York State campaign for Woman Suffrage. However, she followed a rather winding road. Harriot lost her American citizenship... when, in 1882, she married an English businessman and moved to Basingstoke, a town near London. There she raised a family and participated in various political activities. After twenty years abroad, Harriot returned to New York State from England, in 1902, and started organizing for women's rights. She brought with her a more activist approach to politics that she had learned in England from Emmeline Pankhurst, among others. Harriot was deeply interested in the plight of working women and, in 1906, created the Equality League of Self-Supporting Women. Thousands of women employed in factories, laundries, and garment shops joined the League and participated in its open-air meetings, parades, and lobbying efforts. In 1910, the name of the group changed to the Women's Political Union, but the purpose of the organization remained the same - to obtain a State constitutional amendment for Woman Suffrage. Harriot Stanton Blatch was an excellent lobbyist in Albany and brought a new level of energy and enthusiasm to the Suffrage Campaign. It was largely through her efforts that the NYS Legislature voted, in 1913, to submit a Woman Suffrage amendment to the electorate in 1915. However, the political differences between Harriot Stanton Blatch and Carrie Chapman Catt led to a major falling out between the two women. The Women's Political Union eventually merged with the Congressional Union (later the National Woman's Party) led by Alice Paul and Lucy Burns to work for a federal Woman Suffrage amendment and, after that, the passage of the Equal Rights Amendment. When the United States entered World War I, Harriot devoted much of her time to the Women's Land Army and other efforts to support the war. In addition, she wrote books, ran for public office, supported the League of Nations, and worked for world peace.	2016-08-30 16:12:56.848386	\N	f	t	1	https://media1.britannica.com/eb-media/24/76524-004-C738696E.jpg	\N

Her father worked as personal pilot of former Iraqi president Saddam Hussein. Experiencing immediate psychological abuse to her family from Hussein, Salbi chose to dedicate her adult life to the women around the world.\nShe moved to the United States at the age of 19. Salbi's experience with the Iran–Iraq War sensitized her to the plight of women in war worldwide. She has written and spoken extensively on the use of rape and other forms of violence against women during war. Her work has been featured in major media outlets including seven times on The Oprah Winfrey Show and the Washington Post. In 1995, President Bill Clinton honored Salbi at the White House for her humanitarian work in Bosnia.\nSalbi graduated from George Mason University with a Bachelor of Individualized Study degree in Sociology and Women's Studies and from London School of Economics with master's degree in development studies.\nIn the early 1990s, newlyweds Zainab Salbi and Amjad Atallah, a Palestinian-American, were deeply moved by the plight of the women of former Yugoslavia, many of whom were forced into the now infamous rape and concentration camps. They wanted to volunteer to help, but were unable to locate an organization that addressed these injustices and egregious wrongs.\nIn lieu of a honeymoon, Salbi and Atallah, launched an organization that created "sister-to-sister" connections between sponsors in the United States and women survivors of war in Bosnia and Herzegovina. They were greeted with an overwhelming response; a woman survivor of the rape camps who had lost her husband and children during the war said, "I thought the world had forgotten us…."\nThey returned to the United States with a mission. With the continued support of other concerned individuals, they started Women for Women International with a shoestring budget and a small team of dedicated volunteers. Since 1993, Women for Women International has supported women survivors of war in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Rwanda, Kosovo, Nigeria, Colombia, Afghanistan, Iraq, Democratic Republic of Congo and Sudan. Under Salbi's tenure as the CEO of Women for Women International, the organization reached more than 400,000 women in eight conflict areas, distributed more than $100 million in direct aid and microcredit loans, trained thousands of women in rights awareness, and helped thousands more to start their own small businesses.\nIn 2010, President Clinton nominated Salbi as one of the 21st century heroes as featured by Harper’s Bazaar. Newsweek and The Guardian identified her in the Top 100 list of Most Influential Women (2011).\nIn October 2011, Salbi gave a lecture entitled "Building Bridges, Rebuilding Societies" at the University of San Diego's Joan B. Kroc Institute for Peace & Justice Distinguished Lecture Series.\nZainab Salbi is currently working on creating multimedia platforms focused on giving a voice to Arab and Muslim women.\n	2016-08-25 17:40:20.168458	\N	f	t	1	http://static.makers.com/Zainab%20Salbi%20Leadership%20Lesson.jpg	http://www.supersoul.tv/supersoul-sunday/how-lipstick-became-a-weapon-in-the-bosnian-war

602	Bernice Resnick 	Sandler	1928		https://www.womenofthehall.org/	602	For more than four decades, Dr. Bernice Resnick Sandler has been a tireless advocate of educational equality for women and girls.\nFrom 1969-1971, Dr. Sandler served as the Chair of the Action Committee for Federal Contract Compliance of the Women’s Equity Action League.  In this position, she filed charges of sex discrimination against 250 educational institutions using a little-known federal Executive Order prohibiting contractors from discriminating against employees.  It was this strategy that led to the first federal investigations of campus sex discrimination at a time when no laws existed to prohibit discrimination based on gender in education.\nSubsequently, Sandler was instrumental in the development, passage and implementation of Title IX, the legislation that prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex in any federally funded education program or activity.   Working closely with Representative Edith Green (D-OR) in 1970, Dr. Sandler organized and testified at the first congressional hearing dealing specifically with sex discrimination in education and employment.\nIn that same year, Dr. Sandler served as the Educational Specialist for the House of Representatives Special Subcommittee on Education, making her the first woman ever appointed to a Congressional committee staff to work specifically on women’s issues.  In 1971, she wrote the education section for the first federal policy report on sex discrimination in education.  In 1975, Dr. Sandler was appointed by Presidents Ford and Carter as the first Chair of the National Advisory Council on Women’s Educational Programs.\nToday, Dr. Sandler serves as a Senior Scholar in Residence at the Women’s Research and Education Institute in Washington, DC.  An expert in strategies and policies to prevent and respond to sex discrimination in higher education, she has given more than 2,500 presentations.  Dr. Sandler is the recipient of numerous awards, including twelve honorary degrees.\n	2016-08-25 17:40:20.290381	\N	f	t	1	https://www.womenofthehall.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/bernice-resnick-sandler-150x150.jpg

1080	Hannah	Senesh	1921	1944	http://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/szenes-hannah	1056	Hannah Senesh (originally Szenes) was a paratrooper trained to rescue Jews during the Holocaust. Captured and killed by the Nazi's, she is still a national heroine in Israel. Although her family was assimilated, anti-Semitic sentiment in Budapest led her to involvement in Zionist activities, and she left Hungary for Eretz Yisrael in 1939. She studied first at an agricultural school, and then settled at Kibbutz Sdot Yam. While there she wrote poetry, as well as a play about kibbutz life. In 1943, Senesh joined the British Army and volunteered to be parachuted into Europe. The purpose of this operation was to help the Allied efforts in Europe and establish contact with partisan resistance fighters in an attempt to aid beleaguered Jewish communities. Senesh trained in Egypt and was one of the thirty-three people chosen to parachute behind enemy lines. With the goal of reaching her native Budapest, Senesh parachuted into Yugoslavia in March 1944, and spent three months with Tito’s partisans. Her idealism and commitment to her cause are memorialized in her poem “Blessed is the Match,” which she wrote at this time. On June 7, 1944, at the height of the deportation of Hungarian Jews, Senesh crossed the border into Hungary. She was caught almost immediately by the Hungarian police, and tortured cruelly and repeatedly over the next several months. Despite these conditions, Senesh refused to divulge any information about her mission. Even the knowledge that her mother was at risk and that she too might be harmed did not compel Senesh to cooperate with the police. At her trial in October 1944, Senesh staunchly defended her activities and she refused to request clemency. Throughout her ordeal she remained steadfast in her courage, and when she was executed by a firing squad on November 7, she refused the blindfold, staring squarely at her executors and her fate. Through her brief but noteworthy life, Senesh became a symbol of idealism and self-sacrifice. Her poems, made famous in part because of her unfortunate death, reveal a woman imbued with hope, even in the face of adverse circumstances.	2016-08-30 16:22:26.097553	\N	f	t	1	https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8e/Hanna_Senesh_at_kibbutz_Sdot_Yam.jpg	\N

604	Margaret	Sanger	1879	1966	https://www.womenofthehall.org/	604	Margaret Higgins learned from her nonconformist father to be a rebel and to reject prejudice. She married William Sanger, an architect, but after three children and ten years in an affluent Westchester suburb, she yearned for more. The Sangers moved to New York City and plunged into the world of bohemian radicalism in Greenwich Village. Perhaps the radical activist Emma Goldman first introduced her to the issue of birth control. Margaret Sanger worked as a visiting nurse on the Lower East Side. She always said that a poor woman named Sadie Sachs, dying after trying to end an unwanted pregnancy, made her determined to take up the fight.\nSanger published The Women Rebel, a newspaper advocating birth control, and when indicted for sending “obscene” materials through the mails, she fled to Europe and gathered information there. In 1916 she opened a clinic in Brooklyn, was arrested, and served thirty days for distributing information about contraceptives. From then on, Sanger assumed leadership of the struggle for free access to birth control.\nShe was persuasive, tireless, singleminded, and unafraid of a fight. Her arguments might vary — at first she saw birth control as part of a socialist reordering of society, later as a means to prevent the multiplication of the inflicted or to assure happy marriages. But always Sanger saw it as a woman’s issue and she was prepared to take on the medical establishment, the churches, the legislatures, and the courts.

She was a nurturer, scholar, educator, museum founder, author, social activist and inspirational leader to all who knew her.\nSaubel, a Cahuilla Indian, grew up in poverty on reservations in Southern California. At school, speaking her native language was punished, as was opposing how her people were portrayed in history. The first Indian girl to graduate from Palm Springs High School, Saubel’s further education continued after marriage and child-rearing. Scholarships helped her learn anthropology.\nIn 1964, she and others founded the Malki Museum at the Morongo Reservation, the first Native American museum created and managed by Native Americans. Saubel collaborated with scholars and produced books and articles on ethnobiology, Cahuilla grammar and other topics, beginning with Kunvachmal: A Cahuilla Tale in 1969. Saubel’s answer to pressure on Native Americans to abandon their language and beliefs to conform to society was to dedicate her life to preserving both – and with it, her people’s dignity.\n	2016-08-25 17:40:20.358858	\N	f	t	1	https://www.womenofthehall.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/katherine-siva-saubel-150x150.jpg

610	Rose	Schneiderman	1882	1972		610	“The woman worker needs bread, but she needs roses too,” Rose Schneiderman said in 1911. This most famous of Schneiderman’s lines captures the essence of the political philosophy that guided her long and extraordinary career as an internationally recognized leader of American working women. For nearly half a century, Rose Schneiderman worked tirelessly to improve wages, hours, and safety standards for American working women. She saw those things as “bread,” the very basic human rights to which working women were entitled. But she also worked for such “roses” as schools, recreational facilities, and professional networks for trade union women, because she believed that working women deserved much more than a grim subsistence. As president of the New York Women’s Trade Union League (NYWTUL) from 1917 to 1949, and of the National WTUL from 1926 to 1950, Schneiderman served both presidents and governors as a liaison to organized women workers. She was the only woman on FDR’s National Recovery Administration Labor Advisory Board. She played a key role in shaping the landmark legislation of the New Deal: the National Labor Relations Act, the Social Security Act, and the Fair Labor Standards Act. She also helped make New York State a national laboratory for labor and social welfare legislation, first as a lobbyist for the NYWTUL from 1911 to 1932, and then as New York secretary of labor from 1937 to 1943.\nLong an ardent suffragist, Schneiderman had helped found the Wage Earner’s League for Woman Suffrage in 1911 and toured for the Ohio suffrage referendum in 1912. In January 1917, she launched one final, successful drive to win the vote for New York women. That same year, she was elected president of the NYWTUL... By the mid-1920s, Schneiderman was a nationally known figure. In 1926, she was elected president of the National WTUL, a post she retained until her retirement in 1950. Her growing interest in labor legislation had also brought her into a circle of women reformers surrounding a new friend of the NYWTUL, Eleanor Roosevelt... Before long, Schneiderman became a regular guest at the scrambled egg dinners that Roosevelt liked to cook for her friends, and Roosevelt came into contact for the first time with the world of the working class. Her friendship with Schneiderman deepened quickly, and, by the mid-1920s, she was inviting Schneiderman to Hyde Park to spend time with Franklin. These conversations between FDR and Schneiderman laid the foundations for many of the ideas about labor that would become law during his presidency."

612	Patricia	Schroeder	1940		https://www.womenofthehall.org/	612	During her twelve terms in Congress, Patricia Schroeder made an indelible mark on our times through her trailblazing leadership in the House of Representatives, where she worked tirelessly to establish national family policy, including issues like parental leave, child care, family planning, and more. She was also a leader in foreign and military policy, serving on the House National Security Committee, the House Judiciary Committee and chaired the Select Committee on Children, Youth and Families.\nSchroeder, who earned a law degree from Harvard University, was first elected from Colorado in 1972 and continued to serve her constituency until she announced her retirement in late 1995. One of the few women in modern times to become a candidate for the Presidency, Schroeder has always been an outspoken advocate for what she calls “work and family issues,” in recognition of the fact that issues concerning women inevitably impact all families. She wrote and introduced the now-enacted Family and Medical Leave Act in 1985, and has been a primary advocate to enact legislation and secure funding for key legislation to support women’s health research.\nOne of the nation’s most respected women, Patricia Schroeder was not only a sophisticated and successful legislator; she embodies an unblinking commitment to represent the interests of women and their families at the highest levels of government, and do all in her power to see that those interests are served. She does not apologize for her feminism and her advocacy. As she expressed it to The New York Times in 1977, “I have a brain and a uterus, and I use both.”\n	2016-08-25 17:40:20.442001	\N	f	t	1	https://www.womenofthehall.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/patricia-schroeder-150x150.jpg	
613	 Aishah	Schwartz			wisemuslimwomen.org	613	Aishah Schwartz, an American Muslim revert to Islam since April 2002, is founder and director of the 2006-established Washington, D.C.-based Muslimah Writers Alliance (MWA) and a retired 17-year litigation legal assistant. She is also a published freelance non-fiction writer, journalist and internationally renowned human rights activist with a focus on the rights of Muslim women and the plight of Palestinian people affected by Israeli’s embargo on Gaza. As an activist Ms. Schwartz focuses on civil and human rights issues within the Muslim community at-large, particularly those adversely affecting Muslim women. Ms. Schwartz’s writing, primarily autobiographical, generally focuses on countering misconceptions about Islam and her own life as a Muslim. She eventually became a featured writer for Naseeb Vibes, one of the world’s largest online Muslim magazines and social communities. Ms. Schwartz’s articles are also regularly published in The American Muslim (TAM) magazine. \n\nDressed as the Statue of Liberty, Ms. Schwartz addressed French President Jacques Chirac in front of the French embassy in Washington, D.C. as hundreds gathered on January 17, 2004 in protest of an impending law prohibiting Muslim women from wearing the hijab, or head covering. Through MWA her activism received international recognition in 2006 after a successful campaign to avert removal of a prayer space in view of the Kabba designated for women in the courtyard of Makkah’s Grand Mosque. The campaign included a website, online petition, poster declaring “We Have A Right to Pray in This Space!”, and press release that was all directed to King Abdullah bin Abdul Aziz, which was reported on by Egypt’s Al-Ahram Weekly, in which Margot Badran stated “...the most striking example to date of concerted Islamic feminist global protest…”. In September of 2009, Ms. Schwartz’s blog, “Sister Aishah’s Journey” was recognized by The Daily Reviewer, a social blog reader website which establishes the popularity of blogs based upon the number of times a user tags a feed, as one of the top 100 Muslim blogs.\n\nIn 2010 through MWA, Ms. Schwartz continued her work to further advance women’s rights in guardianship laws in Saudi Arabia, and to provide educational opportunities to students in Gaza, in which Mike Ghouse from Foundation of Pluralism stated “This includes four of our heroes, whom I know - Aishah Schwartz…”. Recently, Ms. Schwartz established the film production of a sequel to the Bridges Foundation project, “The Fog is Lifting”, entitled: “Jihad Against Terrorism”, also featuring Imam Suhaib Webb. 	2016-08-25 17:40:20.466338	\N	f	t	1	https://bio.prlog.org/50001433-aishah-schwartz-december-2015.jpg	
614	Anna Jacobson 	Schwartz	1915	2012	https://www.womenofthehall.org/	614	Perhaps the most widely acclaimed female research economist of the twentieth century, Anna Jacobson Schwartz has been described as “one of the world’s greatest monetary scholars.”\nAnna Jacobson became interested in economics while attending Walton High School.  She graduated from Barnard College and went on to earn her Master’s Degree in Economics from Columbia University.  In 1936, she married Isaac Schwartz and began her professional career with Columbia University’s Social Science Research Council.  Schwartz returned to Columbia University and earned a Ph.D.\nDr. Schwartz’s first published paper, “British Share Prices, 1811-1850,” written with Arthur Gayer and Isaiah Finklestein was published in the 1940 issue of The Review of Economics and Statistics.  The paper was a precursor to much of her subsequent work, meticulous in the presentation, explanation and interpretation of data.\nIn 1941, Dr. Schwartz began a more than seventy-year tenure working for the National Bureau of Economic Research.  It was during this time that she met and began working with economist Milton Friedman.  Together, the two coauthored A Monetary History of the United States, 1867 – 1960, which was described by Federal Reserve chairman, Ben Bernanke, as “the leading and most persuasive explanation of the worst economic disaster in American history.”  The massive study demonstrated that changes in monetary policy have large effects on the economy and blamed a large portion of the Great Depression on the Federal Reserve; it is one of the most widely cited texts in economics today.\nIn 1981, Dr. Schwartz served as the Executive Director of the United States Gold Commission, a panel that was responsible for recommending the future of gold in the nation’s monetary system.  In 1988, she was president of the Western Economic Association.\nConsidered a leading financial historian and expert on monetary statistics in the United States and Britain, Dr. Schwartz authored and co-authored several publications during her lifetime.  Her work demonstrated the importance of the behavior of the money supply and the importance of that behavior being stable and predictable, forever changing the entire approach to economic policy making.\n\n	2016-08-25 17:40:20.491676	\N	f	t	1	https://www.womenofthehall.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Anna_Jacobson_Schwartz_40_w_crop-150x150.png

Schwartz, a prolific writer and organizer, helped provide women with better access to the workplace and especially the top levels of corporate America.\nSchwartz’s several books and articles convinced major companies that it was more cost-effective to offer flexible schedules for women than fire a woman manager and train a replacement. Her work was sometimes controversial, such as her call for what was dubbed “the mommy track” by the media, but it always heightened awareness of women’s career conflicts.\nIn 1962, Schwartz founded Catalyst, a national organization to help women re-enter the work force and help companies find women board members. In the 1960s, women represented less than 35% of the workforce. Near the end of the century, they comprised over 46%. From 1977 to 1997, the numbers of women on Fortune 500 company boards grew from 46 to over 400.\nSchwartz’s Catalyst efforts, her pioneering research on job-sharing, dual career couples, parental leave, and other such issues have changed corporate America. Such changes have removed barriers to women’s upward mobility.\n\n	2016-08-25 17:40:20.505479	\N	f	t	1	https://www.womenofthehall.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/felice-n-schwartz-150x150.jpg	
616	Blanche Stuart 	Scott	1889	1970	https://www.womenofthehall.org/	616	Blanche Stuart Scott a pioneering aviator of indomitable spirit of adventure, became the first woman to drive across the United States and the first woman to fly in America.\nWhen she accomplished her transcontinental auto trip, there were only 218 miles of paved roads outside of cities. The publicity led to a contract for her to learn to fly with the newly created Glenn Curtiss Exhibition Company. In August and September of 1910, she took to the air in Hammondsport, NY. On October 23, 1910, she made her first public flight and the first professional appearance of a woman aviator in the country at Fort Wayne, IN.\nIn those years, there was no formal training for aviators and discrimination against women was widespread. She virtually had to teach herself in dangerous and unstable aircraft, and had no career path to look forward to in the industry or the military. Yet, she launched herself into a career of firsts in fields that were completely male-dominated, new and dangerous. Most of her contemporaries felt that “if God had wanted a woman to fly, He would have given her wings.” It was 1910, women couldn’t vote and society still believed woman’s place was in the home.\nBlanche Stuart Scott’s life spanned the era when airplanes were just being invented and given trials, to the moment she saw Neil Armstrong walk on the Moon. She set a long distance flying record for women of 10 miles on July 30, 1911 and then a 25-mile record in August 1911. She performed the lead role in the first movie made about flying, The Aviator’s Bride.\nIn 1912, she joined aviator and designer Glenn Martin and as a Martin employee became the first woman test pilot in America. She participated in many exhibitions in the west as the headliner and became the nation’s first woman stunt pilot, the “Tomboy of the Air.” Accidents and fatalities were frequent in aviation’s early years and Scott suffered an accident in 1913 that caused serious injury. It took her a year to recover. She made few flights after that and retired from active flying in 1916.\nHer subsequent career included screenwriting and many years as a radio personality, but her passionate interest in flying never abated. In September 1948, she became the first woman passenger to ride in a jet plane. The Aeronautics Association of the United States honored her in 1953. In 1954, Scott became a consultant to the United States Air Force Museum and is credited with helping the institution acquire more than $1,000,000 worth of early aviation artifacts. On the 50th anniversary of her first flight, she was honored by the Antique Airplane Association. The U.S. Postal Service honored her with a commemorative stamp in 1980.\n\n	2016-08-25 17:40:20.518715	\N	f	t	1	https://www.womenofthehall.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/blanche-stuart-scott-150x150.jpg

619	Eliabeth Bayley 	Seton	1774	1821	https://www.womenofthehall.org/	619	The first American-born saint of the Roman Catholic Church, Elizabeth Bayley Seton’s early life experiences shaped her faith. She lost her mother at the age of three. At the age of nineteen, she married William Seton and began a family of her own.\nYears later, William took ill with tuberculosis and the family traveled to Italy in search of renewed health. Shortly after arrival, William passed away. Elizabeth remained in Italy with the Filicchi family who shared with her their strong Catholic beliefs. Long a pious member of the Episcopal Church, Seton converted to Catholicism in 1805, a year after her return to New York City. She was promptly disinherited, and anti-Catholic prejudice made it difficult for her to support herself and her children.\nIn 1809, she moved to Baltimore, Maryland and began a school for Catholic girls. The school’s existence was short-lived. Later that same year, Seton took her first vows and received the title of “Mother.” The vows were for a new order that would be known as the Sisters of Charity, the first American Catholic sisterhood. Mother Seton proved an inspired leader and her order quickly grew. Seton next accepted an invitation to start a school in Emmitsburg, Maryland. In 1810, she established St. Joseph’s School, deriving income from boarding students to provide free schooling to needy girls of the local parish. This work led to Mother Seton being widely recognized as the foundress of the parochial school system in the United States.\nIn 1882, it was suggested that her cause for canonization be proposed.

632	Anna Howard	Shaw	1847	1919	https://www.womenofthehall.org/	632	Reverend Doctor Anna Howard Shaw, minister, physician, ardent feminist, and masterful orator, worked to improve individual morality through her ministry, tried to improve society by moving into the temperance and suffrage movements, and finally campaigned vigorously for the League of Nations to promote world peace.\nEssentially self-taught, Shaw’s first career, to help support her family, was as a frontier school teacher. At the age of twelve Shaw had to assume the burden of the survival of her semi-invalid mother and her siblings.\nAfter the Civil War, she was able to move into the home of a married sister and attend high school. She became active in the Methodist church, preaching her first sermon when she was twenty-three and becoming a licensed to preach a year later. In 1873, she entered Albion College, paying for her two years of education there by preaching and giving lectures on temperance. In 1876, she left Albion to attend Boston Theological Seminary. Upon graduation, in 1878, as the only woman in her class, she took charge of a church in East Dennis, Massachusetts, but the General Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church refused her application for ordination because she was a woman. It also took steps to revoke her preaching license. Finally, in 1880, Shaw convinced the Methodist Protestant Church to grant her ordination so she could administer the sacraments and continue her ministry in East Dennis.\nIn addition to ministering at two churches, Shaw earned a medical degree from Boston University in 1886. However, she never practiced medicine. Instead, she resigned her pastorates in 1885 to take up the banners of temperance and women’s suffrage. From the 1880s until her death in 1919, Shaw worked at the grass roots level throughout the country to achieve women’s suffrage. For a few years she headed the Franchise Department of the Woman’s Christian Temperance Union. In 1904 she became president of the National American Woman Suffrage Association. During World War I, Shaw turned her attention to foreign affairs. She became chair of the Woman’s Committee of the United States Council of National Defense, coordinating women’s contributions to the war effort. For this work, in 1919 she became the first woman to earn the Distinguished Service Medal. At the end of the war, at the request of President Wilson and former President Taft, she lectured in the U.S. and Europe in support of world peace and the League of Nations. It was during one of those speaking tours that she fell ill and died in July, 1919, at the age of seventy-two.\nWhile Shaw died just before the Women’s Suffrage Amendment was ratified, she fulfilled her vision of success: “Nothing bigger can come to a human being than to love a great cause more than life itself.”\n\n	2016-08-25 17:40:20.814988	\N	f	t	1	https://www.womenofthehall.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/anna-howard-shaw-150x150.jpg	
634	Catherine Filene 	Shouse	1896	1994	https://www.womenofthehall.org/	634	A philanthropist and patron of the arts, Catherine Filene Shouse (1896-1994) is best remembered for her establishment of Wolf Trap National Park for the Performing Arts. It was because of her significant donations of family land in 1961 and 1966, that this one-of-kind center exists today. She later funded an amphitheater on the site named the Filene Center, in honor of her Boston retailing family.\nAs a result of her college efforts at Wheaton College to promote jobs for educated women, she was hired by the Women’s Division of the Employment Service of the U.S. Department of Labor. She later enrolled at the Harvard Graduate School of Education and in 1923 became the recipient of the school’s first degree awarded to a woman.\nIn 1921, Catherine married economist Alvin Dodd, whom she later divorced. In 1931, she married Jouett Shouse, a former congressman from Kansas. During her residence in the nation’s capital, Shouse became active in Democratic Party politics and was the first woman ever appointed to the Democratic National Committee. In 1926, President Coolidge appointed her the first chairwoman of the first federal prison for women. There, she used her educational background to establish a job-training program for prisoners.\nDuring the next 20 years she developed a highly successful dog-breeding kennel at Wolf Trap and at the same time became very involved in the music and cultural scene in Washington. She was on the board of the National Symphony Orchestra, serving as vice-president for 17 years. In 1959, President Eisenhower appointed her to the first board of the National Cultural Center, now the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, where she served for more than 20 years.\nHer many years of philanthropic support of the arts earned Shouse many honors including Dame Commander of the British Empire from Queen Elizabeth II. The highest U.S. civilian award, the Presidential Medal of Freedom, was awarded to Shouse in 1977 by President Ford.\n\n	2016-08-25 17:40:20.858472	\N	f	t	1	https://www.womenofthehall.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/catherine-filene-shouse-150x150.jpg

631	Anna Howard	Shaw	1947	1919		631	"Dr. Anna Howard Shaw, honorary President of the National American Woman's Suffrage Association, died at her home in Moylan, Penn., near here, at 7 o'clock this evening. She was 72 years old. Dr. Shaw also was Chairman of the Woman's Committee of the Council of National Defense and recently was awarded the Distinguished Service Medal for her work during the war. \nShe was taken ill in Springfield, Illinois, about a month ago while on a lecture tour with former President Taft and President Lowell of Harvard University, in the interest of the League of Nations...Dr. Shaw continued her active participation in public affairs to the last. Immediately preceding the great war, in the early Summer of 1914, Dr. Shaw went to Rome as Chairman of the Committee on Suffrage and Right of Citizenship at the quinquennial season of the International Council of Women...  \nIn the death of the Rev. Dr. Anna Howard Shaw there was brought to a close a life crowded with activities from her earliest youth until her last illness, a career as remarkable as it was rare. The whole course of her life was bent upon human betterment, and she was for many years a leader, especially in the cause of woman suffrage.  \nDr. Shaw was born at Newcastle-on-Tyne, Eng., Feb. 14, 1847, and came to America with her parents in 1853, being nearly shipwrecked on the way over. When she was 9 years old her parents went from Massachusetts to Michigan, settling in what was then a wilderness, 40 miles from a post office and 100 miles from a railroad. In "The Story of a Pioneer," which Dr. Shaw published in 1915, she told the interesting story of her life. The family endured many hardships in that sparsely populated region..She did most of the work in the digging of a well, chopped wood for the big fireplace, felled trees, and later helped in the laying of a floor in the house and putting in doors and windows and partitions. The father was compelled to leave his wife and children at the mercy of Indians and wild animals while he earned a living for them. \nWhen she was 15 she began teaching school, receiving $4 a week and walking eight miles a day... She was determined to have a college education, and by preaching and lecturing, which was frowned upon by members of her family and friends, she managed to pay her way through Albion College, where she studied from 1872 to 1875... She later went to the Theological School of Boston University, where she was graduated in 1878...On account of her sex, she was refused when applying for ordination by the New England Conference and by the General Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church, but in the same year had the honor of being the first woman ordained by the Methodist Protestant Church. In her struggles to become a minister she fought against ridicule, dissension, and lack of the barest necessities...She received a local preacher's license from the District Conference and in 1878 was pastor of the \nMethodist Episcopal Church at Hingham, Mass., and from 1878 to 1885 she was pastor at East Dennis, Mass. She was ordained by the Methodist Protestant Church on Oct. 12, 1880. While serving as pastor of the Dennis congregation Dr. Shaw studied medicine also at Boston University, graduating with the M.D. degree in 1885. Kansas City University conferred on her the honorary degree of D. D. in 1902 and the LL.D. degree in 1917. \nWhen the suffrage movement began to show increasing energy in 1885, Dr. Shaw resigned her pastorate to devote her life to a fight for temperance, suffrage, and social purity. She became the lecturer for the Massachusetts Woman's Suffrage Association, and from 1886 to 1892 she was national superintendent of franchise of the Women's Christian Temperance Union...On the resignation of Dr. Shaw's most intimate friend, Susan B. Anthony, in 1900, the Presidency of the National Woman's Suffrage Association rested between Dr. Shaw and Mrs. Carrie B. Chapman, whom Miss Anthony finally chose as being the more experienced, while Dr. Shaw was made Vice President-at-Large. She had been national lecturer for the organization since 1886 and continued in this work until 1904, when Mrs. Chapman Catt was compelled to resign the Presidency on account of ill health, and Dr. Shaw succeeded her as head of the National Association. She served in this capacity until 1915, when she declined re-election..." Excerpts from Shaw's July 3, 1919 Obituary in The New York Times:\n"Dr. Anna H. Shaw, Suffragist, Dies"\n \n	2016-08-25 17:40:20.78568	\N	f	f	1	http://www.famousbirthdays.com/thumbnails/shaw-anna-large.jpg	
635	Eunice Kennedy 	Shriver	1921	2009	https://www.womenofthehall.org/	635	For more than thirty years, Eunice Kennedy Shriver served as a leader in the worldwide struggle to enhance the lives of people with intellectual disabilities.\nAfter her graduation from Stanford University, she worked for the U.S. State Department in the Special War Problems Division, and later became a social worker.  Relocating to Chicago, Illinois in 1951, Shriver worked with the House of the Good Shepherd and the Chicago Juvenile Court.\n  In 1957, Shriver took over leadership of the Joseph P. Kennedy, Jr. Foundation, named in honor of her late brother.  During her tenure, the foundation aided in the creation of The President’s Committee on Mental Retardation (1961) as well as the development of the National Institute for Child Health and Human Development (1962).\n Throughout the late 1950s and early 1960s, Shriver visited institutions for people with intellectual disabilities.  Appalled by the treatment of these individuals and motivated by the notion that given the right opportunities, they would be more capable than commonly believed, she began Camp Shriver in 1962.  At the summer day camp, held at her home, Shriver led attendees through a variety of physical activities.  It was here that the Camp Shriver concept – through sports people with intellectual disabilities can realize their potential for growth – was developed.  The concept began to spread, and in 1968, the first International Special Olympics Games were held in Chicago.  At the ceremony, Shriver announced the creation of a national program, the Special Olympics, formed to give people with intellectual disabilities “the chance to play, the chance to compete and the chance to grow.”\n Shriver was the recipient of many honors, including the Presidential Medal of Freedom (1984), the nation’s highest civilian award.  In 2009, the U.S. National Portrait Gallery unveiled a historic painting of Shriver; this work was the gallery’s first commissioned portrait of an individual who has not served as a U.S. President or First Lady.\nToday, Shriver’s legacy lives on through the Special Olympics.\n	2016-08-25 17:40:20.877493	\N	f	t	1	https://www.womenofthehall.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/eunice-kennedy-shriver-150x150.jpg	
636	Muriel	Siebert	1928	2013	https://www.womenofthehall.org/	636	Known as the “First Woman of Finance”, Muriel Siebert forever left her mark on the business world when she became the first woman, among 1,365 men, to own a seat on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).\nShe began her financial career as a $65 a week research trainee at Bache & Company and worked her way up through various brokerages. In 1967, she established her own firm, Muriel Siebert & Company, Inc., doing research for institutions and buying and selling financial analyses. In 1975, when members of the NYSE were first permitted to negotiate broker commissions, Siebert transformed her company into the nation’s first discount brokerage.\nIn 1977, Siebert left her firm for five years to become the first female Superintendent of Banking for the State of New York, responsible for oversight of all banks and other financial institutions within the state. During her tenure, she often acted boldly and controversially to launch protective measures to ensure the safety of state banks. Despite the common nationwide failures of financial institutions, not one New York State bank failed during Siebert’s term.\nIn 1990, Siebert expanded her philanthropic reach with the creation of the Siebert Entrepreneurial Philanthropic Program. Through the program, she shared half of her firm’s profits from new securities underwriting with charities of the issuer’s choice.\nWhile serving as president of the New York Women’s Agenda in 1999, Siebert developed a Personal Finance Program to provide youth with financial management skills. The program is currently being taught in New York City Schools and has been distributed by the Council of Great City Schools. It was her hope that the program will one day be established nationally.\nSiebert continued to oversee the day to day operations at the seven branches of her firm until her death, ensuring that her contributions as a businesswoman and philanthropist will shape our nation for years to come.\n\n	2016-08-25 17:40:20.900669	\N	f	t	1	https://www.womenofthehall.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/muriel-siebert-150x150.jpg

Sills delighted audiences around the world with her talent and charisma. A member of the New York City Opera from 1955 to 1980, she performed in the world’s leading opera houses, recorded 18 full-length operas and numerous solo collections, and appeared in hundreds of television programs. In addition to the many awards for her albums, Sills received four Emmys for her weekly television program, Lifestyles with Beverly Sills. Her autobiography, Bubbles: A Self -Portrait, became a bestseller. Under her leadership at the New York City Opera, opera became accessible to the masses when she introduced to American audiences the use of subtitles for all foreign language productions — a method soon adopted in opera houses around the world.\nAfter retirement from performing, Sills served as General Director and then President of the New York City Opera. In 1993, she became the first woman, the first performing artist and the first former head of an arts company to become chair of the Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts, which encompasses 11 world-renowned institutions, including the Metropolitan Opera, the New York Philharmonic and the New York City Ballet.\nSills also was actively involved in a myriad of charities and organizations, including the National Victim Center, the Hebrew Home for the Aged at Riverdale, and the March of Dimes Mother’s March on Birth Defects, for which she served as national chair.

638	Dolly	Sinatra	1896	1977		638	Dolly Sinatra’s primary trade was as a midwife. And, as a midwife, she was known not just for delivering babies, but for providing safe abortions for Catholic Italian women across Hoboken, earning her the nickname “Hatpin Dolly.” This was at a time, mind you, when abortion was illegal–Dolly put herself at incredible risk in order to help these women.\n\nNot only that, but in 1919, she chained herself to City Hall in support of women’s suffrage. In the 1920s, she became the Democratic leader of Hoboken’s third ward, using her ability to speak both Italian and English to advocate for the rights of new immigrants. She was reportedly very powerful in this position, and essentially ran half of Hudson County due to her ability to deliver votes.\n\nShe also ran a damn saloon during Prohibition, which is pretty freaking awesome as well.\n\nSinatra said of his mother:\n\n“My mother is what you would call a progressive. She decided she didn’t want to be just a housekeeper and studied nursing and is now a graduate nurse. She was always interested in conditions outside her own home. My father, too, but he was the more silent type.”\n\n“My mother influenced me a great deal. She was a self taught woman, very bright, had good common sense and was a hard worker … My earliest memories of my father, Marty, are in the kitchen. He did much of the cooking, as Dolly, my mother was a powerful force and dedicated worker in the political arena. She was out there fighting for women’s rights before women even knew they should have them.”	2016-08-25 17:40:20.935554	\N	f	t	1	http://static.thefrisky.com/uploads/2015/12/dolly-sinatra.jpg

643	Eleanor Cutri 	Smeal	1939		https://www.womenofthehall.org/	643	As one of the co-founders of The Feminist Majority Foundation, a former president of the National Organization for Women, and publisher of Ms. Magazine, Eleanor Smeal’s life and work has been dedicated to the achievement of women’s equality and human rights. Known as a political analyst, strategist, and grassroots organizer, Ms. Smeal has played a pivotal role in defining the debate, developing the strategies, and charting the direction of the modern day women’s movement. In her more than 40 years as a leader in the United States’ women’s movement, she has changed the landscape of women’s involvement in national life and culture.\nOne of the modern architects of the drive for women’s equality, Ms. Smeal’s 1984 book, How and Why Women Will Elect the Next President, predicted that women’s votes would be decisive in presidential politics. In this writing she was the first to identify the “gender gap”, the difference in the way women and men vote, and popularized its usage in election and polling analyses to enhance women’s voting clout. Her leading role in state and national campaigns for women’s rights legislation, including the Equal Rights Amendment, helped reshape the contours of U.S. politics as politicians could no longer ignore the voices of women, forcing their inclusion as part of the national political discourse. Her efforts led to women’s organizations shifting the strategy of targeting only a few select races for women candidates to a philosophy of recruiting women to run for as many elected offices as possible.

653	Sarinya	Srisakul			http://www.unitedwomenfirefighters.org/	653	Sarinya Srisakul is the first and only woman firefighter of Asian descent in the Fire Department of New York. For Srisakul, who was born and raised in Mount Vernon, New York, the journey into the fire service was anything but preordained. It began in 2000, during her third year at Parsons School of Design in Manhattan, when she decided to drop out.\n\n"I've been an activist my entire life and always wanted to help people," Srisakul said. With art, she said, she didn't see that happening. She took a job at the New York City AIDS Housing Network, a non-profit that assists low-income New Yorkers with HIV and AIDS. In 2002, a female friend who applied to become a firefighter in San Francisco urged Srisakul to take the test for the FDNY.\n\n"I went to the orientation, and it was a calling," she said. "This was what I wanted to do with my life." She has been a NYC firefighter since 2005. She is also an activist who works on creating social justice and gender equality through her work with the United Women Firefighters.

In 1950, her role as a Thai representative abroad would take on new meaning when she married King Bhumibol Adulyadej and later became Her Majesty Queen Regent Sirikit. \nQueen Sirikit launched the Association for the Conservation of Wildlife and the Wildlife Fund of Thailand. She supports forward-thinking economic initiatives to bring jobs in conservation to her country and, in an effort to encourage Thai women, she personally financed weaving looms and “seed” money for businesses producing handcrafted items native to the country.\nQueen Sirikit is renowned for her charitable work, especially her relief work with the many refugees from Cambodia and Myanmar, which earned her The Center of Migration Studies’ Immigration and Refugee Policy Award in 1990. In the years to follow, she would win other accolades from the United Nations, The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center, and International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources, among others.\nPhoto: Queen Sirikit arriving at ‪‎NYC‬ heliport, circa 1966.\nImage Courtesy: NYC Department of Records	2016-08-25 17:40:20.947374	\N	f	t	1	https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/04/Queen_Sirikit_NYWTS.jpg	
644	Bessie	Smith	1894	1937	https://www.womenofthehall.org/	644	At the age of nine, Bessie Smith was singing on the streets of Chattanooga, Tennessee. She joined a traveling vaudeville show as a dancer, but it was soon apparent that her singing talent outshone her dance ability. Inspired by Gertrude “Ma” Rainey, Bessie found that her deep, soulful voice was ideally suited to the new blues music.\nShe quickly became a favorite entertainer on the theater circuit. In 1923, Columbia Records issued her first recording, “Down-Hearted Blues”, which was a huge success. She was soon the highest paid black entertainer in the country. She composed many of her own songs, and when she sang the blues, she sang of the American Black experience – suffering and joy, betrayal and courage. An extraordinary talent, Bessie was given the title “Empress of the Blues” by her fans and her peers.\nOff-stage, Bessie Smith was a volatile personality with a zest for life. She enjoyed her fame, spending freely without thought for the future. In the 1930s, however, the Great Depression and talking movies crippled vaudeville and nearly killed the recording industry. This was a difficult period for her, although she continued to work.\nIn 1937 Bessie Smith had begun to stage a successful comeback, adapting her powerful voice to the new swing music. While on tour, she was fatally injured in a car accident. The greatest blues singer of her time, she left a musical legacy that grew as her recording inspired later performers.\n\n	2016-08-25 17:40:21.030974	\N	f	t	1	https://www.womenofthehall.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/bessie-smith-150x150.jpg	
645	Margaret Chase 	Smith	1897	1995	https://www.womenofthehall.org/	645	Margaret Chase Smith was the daughter of a barber in Skowhegan, Maine. Unable to afford college, she pursued a career in office work at the telephone company and a weekly newspaper until, at the age of thirty-four, she married Clyde Harold Smith, a prominent Republican politician twenty-one years her senior.\nWhen Smith was elected to the House of Representatives, Margaret served as his secretary. After he suffered a heart attack in 1940, she filed for the primary in his place, intending to withdraw when he recovered. His unexpected death left her heir to the Republican nomination, which nearly guaranteed election in the state of Maine. Margaret Chase Smith went on to serve well and win repeated reelection in her own right.\nHer independent views were evident in her very first vote, defying isolationist sentiment in her party to support the draft. In 1948 she went after the newly vacant Senate seat and won a hotly contested Republican primary with a low budget grassroots campaign. She went on to serve four full terms in the “most exclusive men’s club in the world,” the U.S. Senate becoming the first woman to serve in both houses and the first woman to represent Maine in either house.\nShe was famous for her early challenge of McCarthyism. In 1950, she and six other Senators issued a “declaration of conscience” denouncing “hate and character assassination,” though neglecting to mention Joseph McCarthy by name. She consistently supported a strong national defense and became known as the “Mother of the WAVES” for her efforts to advance the position of women in the Navy. She was a staunch cold warrior, charging that President Kennedy was afraid to stand up to the Communists and voting against the nuclear test ban treaty. In 1970 she issued a second “declaration of conscience,” deploring the hatred and extremism of the Vietnam War era.\n\n	2016-08-25 17:40:21.041314	\N	f	t	1	https://www.womenofthehall.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/margaret-chase-smith-150x150.jpg	
650	Betty Reid	Soskin	1922			650	\nAt age 94, Betty Reid Soskin is a powerful voice for helping people process history while protecting historic spaces for future generations.\n \nBetty Reid Soskin, the oldest full-time national park ranger in the United States, is two months shy of her 95th birthday. The National Park Service itself is only five years older than that.\n\nFor the last 10 years, Soskin has served as an interpretive ranger at the Rosie the Riveter WWII Home Front National Historical Park in Redmond, California, where you’d get little argument that she is the most beloved and sought-after park ranger.\n\nBut on June 27, an intruder broke into her home in Richmond, California, and punched her several times. She managed to get away and lock herself in her bathroom, where she proceeded to plug in her iron and wait for her attacker to return so she could brand him.\n\nInstead, he escaped with some of Soskin’s prized possessions, including a commemorative coin from President Obama. But true to Soskin’s spirit and strength, she is now back to work just three weeks after the attack.\n\nSoskin’s life in the 85 years prior to joining the National Park Service reflects a changing and growing country. Her great-grandmother was born a slave in Louisiana and lived to be 102, while her mother reached 101.\n\nHer family’s relocation to California when Soskin was young set her on a unique path. In California in the early 1900s, women of color generally had two avenues of employment: domestic servant or teacher.\n\nBut Henry Keiser and his shipyard in Richmond gave Soskin a third option: She worked as a clerk for the Boilermakers Union A-36 at the shipyard during World War II.\n\nWhile the shipyard offered an opportunity, it was still a segregated working environment. Soskin’s experience as a woman of color later filled in some holes while identifying sites for Rosie the Riveter park, helping to paint a more accurate picture of the war effort there.\n\nAs Soskin reminds us, “what gets remembered is determined by who is in the room doing the remembering.” She believes parks like Rosie the Riveter are important to cultural identity and our future, because “they can help us process our collective history, even the painful parts.”\n\nAfter the shipyards, Soskin went on to work in academia, as a songwriter during the Civil Rights Movement, as a community activist, and as a field representative for California Assemblywomen Dion Aroner and Loni Hancock, which led to her work designing and ultimately working at Rosie the Riveter park.\n\n\nToday she is still a small business owner, with Reid’s Records celebrating more than 70 years in business.\n\n\nAccording to Soskin, urban parks like Rosie the Riveter help bring national parks to people who may not otherwise be able to get to remote places like Yosemite or Yellowstone. It is not lost on her that tax dollars pay for U.S. national parks, yet many of the country’s citizens cannot access them.\n\n\nAt the same time, more people live in urban areas today compared to a hundred years ago, so identifying and designating more of these spaces is vital. Soskin argues that urban parks are as important as our wild spaces, because “the urban spaces combined with nature tells the American story. Our parks are our American story.”\n	2016-08-25 17:40:21.129107	\N	f	t	1	http://www.sierraclub.org/sites/www.sierraclub.org/files/styles/flexslider_full/public/sierra/articles/big/Betty-Reid-Soskin-735x459.jpg?itok=vRnm6s6q	
647	Sophia	Smith	1796	1870	https://www.womenofthehall.org/	647	Sophia Smith, born in Hatfield, Massachusetts in 1796, was one of seven children of a prosperous and frugal New England farmer. As a young girl, Sophia strove to achieve the type of education generally closed to women in the early nineteenth century. She attended a local school and, for one term, an academy in Hartford, Connecticut. She then continued her education informally, reading widely throughout her life. Deaf by the age of forty, Sophia spent most of her time at home and involved with her church. By 1861, at the age of sixty-five, Sophia was the last of her immediate family. With careful management and wise investments, her brothers and uncles had increased the family wealth to a small fortune. Determined to do something meaningful with her money, Sophia consulted her pastor and others. Eventually, she decided to endow a woman’s college, to be located in Northampton, Massachusetts. The college, she hoped, would provide the highest quality undergraduate education for young women – equal to that provided at the time for young men – thus enabling women to develop their intellects and talents and to participate effectively and fully in all areas of American society.\nUpon her death in 1870, Sophia’s bequest of nearly $400,000 became the foundation for the establishment of Smith College, which was chartered in 1871 and then opened its doors in 1875 with 14 students. Since its humble beginnings in 1871, tens of thousands of women from around the world have attended Smith College. They have gone on to serve as leaders in their communities and their nations. Sophia Smith truly achieved her goal: to establish an institution of higher education for women that would impart an education by which women could “incalculably” enlarge “their power for good” by increasing their role in society and the economy and working to reform “the evils of society . . . as teachers, as writers, as mothers, [and] as members of society.”\n\n	2016-08-25 17:40:21.065363	\N	f	t	1	https://www.womenofthehall.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/sophia-smith-150x150.jpg	
648	Hannah Greenebaum 	Solomon	1858	1942	https://www.womenofthehall.org/	648	As the visionary founder of the National Council of Jewish Women, Hannah Greenebaum Solomon spent her lifetime organizing communities to work cooperatively for social good.\nSolomon and her sister, Henriette Frank, were very active in Chicago social clubs and organizations, and were the first Jewish members of the Chicago Women’s Club. In 1890, Solomon was asked to organize a nationwide Jewish Women’s Congress as part of the World’s Fair. The Congress became the National Council of Jewish Women, to teach all Jewish women their obligations to their faith and to the community. Solomon was the Council’s first president, encouraging local chapters to be founded nationwide. She was also involved in creating the Council of Women of the United States. In 1904, Solomon journeyed to Berlin with her friend and fellow suffragist Susan B. Anthony for a convention of the International Council of Women.\nSolomon was a lifelong activist in Chicago, working with Jane Addams at Hull House, advocating for reform and improvements in child welfare, reforming the Illinois Industrial School for Girls, and even involving herself in improving the city’s waste disposal systems. She established penny lunch stations in the public schools, and placed the first probation officers for juvenile delinquents in the courts. During World War I, she was chairperson of all Chicago City ward leaders, dealing successfully with the city’s forty different nationalities to coordinate war efforts. She also worked for slum clearance, low cost housing, child labor laws, mothers” pensions and public health measures.\nToday, the National Council of Jewish Women is the oldest active Jewish women’s volunteer organization in America. It stands as a living testimony to the vision of its activist founder, as well as the positive energy organized women can exert for the good of the larger community.\n\n	2016-08-25 17:40:21.078242	\N	f	t	1	https://www.womenofthehall.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/hannah-greenebaum-solomon-150x150.jpg	
649	Susan	Solomon	1956		https://www.womenofthehall.org/	649	Susan Solomon is widely recognized as a leader in the field of atmospheric science. She is best known for having both pioneered the theory explaining how and why the ozone hole occurs in Antarctica, and obtaining some of the first chemical measurements establishing manmade chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) as its cause. Solomon forged an early interest in science while watching such shows as The Undersea World of Jacques Cousteau. By high school, she directed her focus toward atmospheric science after placing in a national science contest. Her project measured the amount of oxygen in various gaseous mixtures. After receiving her bachelor’s degree in chemistry from Illinois Institute of Technology, Solomon earned her doctorate at the University of California at Berkeley. In 1981, she began working at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in Boulder, Colorado. She is now the Ellen Swallow Richards Professor of Atmospheric Chemistry and Climate Science at MIT. In 1986 and 1987, Solomon led expeditions to Antarctica, observing that levels of chlorine dioxide were one hundred times greater than predicted. This was the first direct evidence that pointed to chlorine chemistry as the cause of the Antarctic ozone hole. Solomon received the National Medal of Science in 1999 in chemistry for “her key scientific insights in explaining the cause of the Antarctic ozone hole and for advancing the understanding of the global ozone layer; for changing the direction of ozone research through her findings; and for exemplary service to worldwide public policy decisions and to the American public.” Her current research includes climate change, ozone depletion, and the links between them. She served as co-chair of Working Group 1 of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) from 2002-2008. The IPCC provides comprehensive scientific assessments of climate change for the public and for policy makers. The organization shared the Nobel Peace Prize with Albert Gore, Jr. in 2007. Solomon has received numerous other awards in recognition of her work, including the Blue Planet Prize from the Asahi Foundation in Japan, the Carl-Gustaf Rossby Medal from the American Meteorological Society, and the William Bowie Medal from the American Geophysical Union. Antarctica’s Solomon Glacier and Solomon Saddle were named in honor of her research. 	2016-08-25 17:40:21.107487	\N	f	t	1	https://www.womenofthehall.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/susan-solomon-150x150.jpg	
654	Elizabeth Cady 	Stanton	1815	1902	https://www.womenofthehall.org/	654	Widely credited as one of the founding geniuses of the women’s rights movement, Elizabeth Cady Stanton used her brilliance, insightfulness, and eloquence to advocate for many important issues. In addition to being one of the first women’s rights activists, she was also a dedicated abolitionist, and advocated in favor of temperance. Unlike many of her contemporaries, Stanton enjoyed a formal education at Johnstown Academy, where she worked hard to excel in Greek, Latin, and mathematics. The child of a judge, she went on to obtain the finest education then available to women at Troy Female Seminary. A visit to her cousin, abolitionist Gerrit Smith, in Peterboro, New York, helped foster her strong anti-slavery sentiments. At her insistence, when she married abolitionist Henry Stanton, the word “obey” was omitted from the ceremony. Their honeymoon journey was to the great World’s Anti-Slavery Convention in London in 1840. After the women delegates were denied seats at that convention, Stanton became convinced that women should hold a convention demanding their own rights. This decision was delayed until her move to Seneca Falls, where she was isolated and increasingly exhausted by a growing family. Finally in July, 1848, she met with Lucretia Mott and three other Quaker women in nearby Waterloo, New York. Together they issued the call for the first woman’s rights convention. Stanton drafted the Seneca Falls Convention’s Declaration of Sentiments, including the historic words “We hold these truths to be self-evident: that all men and women are created equal‚” She continued to argue forcefully for the ballot, a radical demand opposed by her husband and even Mrs. Mott. Soon thereafter, she met Susan B. Anthony and they formed what would be a lifelong partnership devoted to the cause. Among their earliest targets were laws that discriminated against married women, denying them the right to hold property, or wages, or guardianship of their children. A prolific author whose works included Solitude of Self and The Woman’s Bible, Stanton once wrote that “The prolonged slavery of woman is the darkest page in human history.” 	2016-08-25 17:40:21.176903	\N	f	t	1	https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/da/Elizabeth_Stanton.jpg

664	Brenda E. 	Stevenson			www.womensenews.org	664	Brenda E. Stevenson: Los Angeles' Challenger of the Accepted History\n\n\nThree women, each of vastly different heritages, each with their own experiences of being an outsider in the United States, were central players that set the stage for the 1992 Los Angeles riots, touched off by videotape of the brutal police assault on Rodney King and the videotaped murder of Latasha Harlins. This is the case made by historian Brenda E. Stevenson, recipient of the 2015 Women's eNews Ida B. Wells Award for Bravery in Journalism.\n\n"This riot was boiling forth from the moment Latasha Harlins was shot," Stevenson said.\n\nStevenson's careful and nuanced examination of race, gender and class in the book "The Contested Murder of Latasha Harlins: Justice, Gender and the Origins of the LA Riots" provides the family history of three women most deeply involved in a moment of violence in a small grocery store in Los Angeles: the teen victim, the shooter and the trial judge. Each one's family left their homes to seek freedom and economic opportunity, one each from the U.S. South, from pre-war Europe and from South Korea.\n\nStevenson documents how each one's heritage and experiences gave them much in common and how their differences in family stature played a significant role in the outcome of the criminal trial of the store owner who shot unarmed Harlins point-blank but was acquitted of murder and served no jail time for a felony manslaughter conviction.\n\nA tenured history professor on the faculty of UCLA, Stevenson is in the first generation of her family to attend college, receiving her doctorate in American history at Yale University. She grew up in a Virginia coastal town listening to her mother, Emma Gerald Stevenson, tell tales of life in South Carolina.\n\n"So many wonderful and so many terrifying stories," Stevenson said. Her father, James Stevenson, a longshoreman and union organizer, was able to send all three of his daughters to college and graduate school, the family's dream.\n\n"The Harlins book looks at the history and systemic problems within the criminal justice system," said Stevenson. "Not just police, but also juries, judges, prosecutors, all have problematic issues that often break along racial lines. Women are also players in this system and are invested in, as well as victimized by, that system. Black women are similarly victimized as black men, and that must be considered."\n\nStevenson added, "Black women are completely out of this discourse of unfair treatment under the law and by the law--by the police as well as in the courts, and by juries and judges . . . Even President Obama seems not to realize the tragic place black women have in our criminal justice system, and he has two daughters."\n\n--By Rita Henley Jensen\n	2016-08-25 17:40:21.360889	\N	f	t	1	http://cms.ipressroom.com.s3.amazonaws.com/173/files/20125/532cabbaaf4460264b000086_271594_Brenda_Stevenson/271594_Brenda_Stevenson_thmb.jpg

666	Pastor Rose	Stokes	1879	1933		666	Rose Wieslander, the daughter of Jacob and Anna Wieslander, was born in Russia on 18th July 1879. When the marriage broke down, Anna brought Rose to the East End of London. Soon afterwards, Anna married Israel Pastor.\n\nRose Pastor attended Bell Lane Free School but at the age of eight she found work in a Whitechapel factory. In 1891 the family emigrated to Cleveland, Ohio. According to her biographer, Judith Rosenbaum: "Rose found work in a 'buck-eye', the cigar-sweatshop in which many Jews labored. She worked as an unskilled 'stogey-roller' for twelve years. After Israel Pastor abandoned the family, she became the sole supporter of six. For those who later popularized her character in the media, this period of her life often faded to an idealized working-class experience, but for Rose herself, it stood out as formative for her identity."\n\nRose Pastor sent regular letters to the Jewish Daily News. The editor was impressed with her contributions and in 1902 she was offered a regular column in the newspaper with a salary of $15 per week. Rose now moved to New York City and took an apartment in Lower East Side.\n\nJournalist\nRose Pastor took a keen interest in politics and began a series of articles on university settlements. The movement, based on the achievements of Toynbee Hall in the East End of London, had been established by Jane Addams and Ellen Starr at Hull House in Chicago in 1889. The idea behind the movement was that people from privileged backgrounds should live amongst the poor.\n\n\n\nIn 1903 she interviewed Graham Stokes, the New York City millionaire who at that time a supporter of the University Settlement in the city. James Boylan, the author of Revolutionary Lives: Anna Strunsky and William English Walling (1998), has pointed out: "James Graham Phelps Stokes... brother of the architect, Newton... was a member of one of the city's old and wealthy mercantile families; he had to look after family businesses, but his heart was with New York's social and reform enterprises, which placed him on more boards and committees than he could efficiently serve. The Stokeses were particularly important to the University Settlement; in addition to Newton's role, his sisters were part-time volunteers, and Graham himself was a member of the governing council."\n\nRose Pastor Stokes & Socialism\nRose Pastor was very impressed with what Stokes had to say and became a volunteer worker at the settlement. The couple were married in July 1905 and moved to a house in Greenwich, Connecticut. Later that year the couple joined the Socialist Party of America. Other members included Eugene Debs, Victor Berger, Ella Reeve Bloor, Emil Seidel, Daniel De Leon, Philip Randolph, Chandler Owen, William Z. Foster, Abraham Cahan, Sidney Hillman, Morris Hillquit, Walter Reuther, Bill Haywood, Margaret Sanger, Florence Kelley, Mary White Ovington, Helen Keller, Inez Milholland, Floyd Dell, William Du Bois, Hubert Harrison, Upton Sinclair, Agnes Smedley, Victor Berger, Robert Hunter, George Herron, Kate Richards O'Hare, Helen Keller, Claude McKay, Sinclair Lewis, Daniel Hoan, Frank Zeidler, Max Eastman, Bayard Rustin, James Larkin, William Walling and Jack London.\n\nIn September 1905, Rose Pastor Stokes and Graham Stokes joined with Upton Sinclair, Jack London, Clarence Darrow and Florence Kelley to form the Intercollegiate Socialist Society. The main objective of the organization was to encourage study and discussion of socialism in colleges. Rose continued work as a journalist and was a regular contributor to the The Masses and The Call.\n\nRose Pastor Stokes\n\nAlthough Rose Pastor Stokes was now extremely wealthy she remained a committed socialist. As Eugene Debs pointed out: "She had her millions of dollars at command. Did her wealth restrain her an instant? On the contrary her supreme devotion to the cause outweighed all considerations of a financial or social nature. She went out boldly to plead the cause of the working class."\n\nFirst World War\nOn the outbreak of the First World War most socialists in the United States were opposed to the conflict. They argued that the war had been caused by the imperialist competitive system and argued that the America should remain neutral. This was also the view expressed in the three main socialist journals, Appeal to Reason, The Masses and The Call.\n\nRose Pastor Stokes was also involved in the struggle to keep the United States out of the war. Graham Stokes disagreed with her on this issue and along with his friends, William English Walling, Jack London, Charles Edward Russell, John Spargo and Upton Sinclair, thought that President Woodrow Wilson should send troops to fight the German Army in Europe. Stokes began to attack those in the the American Socialist Party who opposed the war as really being secret supporters of Germany.\n\nEugene Debs, Max Eastman and Rose Pastor Stokes\nRose Pastor Stokes\nEmma Goldman was furious with Graham Stokes and other pro-war socialists and wrote in Mother Earth: "The black scourge of war in its devastating effect upon the human mind has never been better illustrated than in the ravings of the American Socialists, Messrs. Russell, Stokes, Sinclair, Walling, et al.... As to English Walling, he was the reddest of the red. Though muddled mentally he was always at white heat emotionally as syndicalist, revolutionist, dissenter, etc... One might overlook the renegacy of a Charles Edward Russell. Nothing else need ever be expected from a journalist. But for men like Stokes and Walling to thus become the lackeys of Wall Street and Washington, is really too cheap and disgusting."\n\nArrested under the Espionage Act\nRose Pastor Stokes continued her campaign against the war. On 22nd March, 1918, she was arrested and charged under the Espionage Act. She was accused of making anti-war speeches but the authorities were especially upset by a letter she sent to Kansas City Star where she argued: "No government which is for the profiteers can also be for the people, and I am for the people, while the government is for the profiteers.” She was found guilty and sentenced to ten years in prison. Stokes’s conviction was appealed twice before the decision was reversed in March 1920, on the grounds that the charge to the jury was prejudicial against the defendant.\n\nEugene Debs, Max Eastman and Rose Pastor Stokes\nEugene Debs, Max Eastman and Rose Pastor Stokes\nRose Pastor Stokes experiences moved her to the revolutionary left. The right-wing leadership of the Socialist Party of America opposed the Russian Revolution. On 24th May 1919 the leadership expelled 20,000 members who supported the Soviet government. The process continued and by the beginning of July two-thirds of the party had been suspended or expelled.\n\nIn September 1919, Rose Pastor Stokes, Jay Lovestone, Earl Browder, John Reed, James Cannon, Bertram Wolfe, William Bross Lloyd, Benjamin Gitlow, Charles Ruthenberg, Mikhail Borodin, William Dunne, Elizabeth Gurley Flynn, Louis Fraina, Ella Reeve Bloor, Juliet Poyntz, Nathan Silvermaster, Jacob Golos, Claude McKay, Max Shachtman, Martin Abern, Michael Gold and Robert Minor, decided to form the Communist Party of the United States. Within a few weeks it had 60,000 members whereas the Socialist Party of America had only 40,000.\n\nMarriage to Issac Romain\nGraham Stokes did not share his wife's communist beliefs. Rose suggested they had become "friendly enemies". In 1925 her husband brought a petition for divorce on grounds of misconduct.\n\nIn 1925 Rose became involved with Victor Jerome. At the time he was twenty-nine and she was forty-seven. Stokes wrote to Jeanette Pearl about the new man in her life: "I'm interfering with his studies and I'm afraid he's interfering with my peace of mind.... I'm mighty near being at that extent that I shall lose all sane judgment. Don't fall in love, Jean. It's an enslaver of life." The couple married in February, 1927.\n\nIn 1929 Rose was seriously injured when clubbed by police at a demonstration demanding the withdrawal of U.S. forces from Haiti. According to a report in the Daily Chronicle Rose "was struck while attempting to protect a young boy from a policeman".\n\nAccording to Judith Rosenbaum: "In 1930, Stokes was diagnosed with a malignant breast tumor, which she attributed to having received a blow on the breast from a policeman’s club during a demonstration - claiming martyrdom for the proletarian cause. Her health rapidly declined; even so, she maintained her radical, fighting spirit. Although her illness prevented her from remaining active in the Communist Party during the last years of her life, she continued to assert her allegiance to it."\n\nRose Pastor Stokes moved to Germany to have radiation therapy but died in Frankfurt on 20th June, 1933.	2016-08-25 17:40:21.3933	\N	f	t	1	http://spartacus-educational.com/00pastor6.jpg

670	Kate	Stoneman	1841	1925	https://www.womenofthehall.org/	670	The first woman admitted to practice law in the state of New York, Kate Stoneman paved the way for thousands who followed.\nIn 1864, she left the family farm for Albany, New York to pursue an education at the New York State Normal College, the only state school training teachers for the public schools. Following her graduation in 1866, she worked as a teacher for forty years. During her early years of teaching, Stoneman began to take an interest in women’s suffrage. She and others formed the Woman’s Suffrage Society of Albany, lobbying for the extension of school suffrage to women. Her interest in law was piqued when she was designated executrix of her great aunt’s estate.\nAfter three years of studying law and clerking for an attorney, Stoneman became the first woman to pass the New York State Bar Examination in 1885. When Stoneman subsequently applied for admission to the bar, she was denied due to her sex. Just prior to her bar application, a bill was introduced removing gender requirements for admittance to the bar; however, the bill had been stuck in the judiciary committee. Stoneman launched a successful lobbying campaign to secure its passage. On May 20, 1886, with the new legislation in hand, Stoneman reapplied for admission to the bar. Her application was accepted and she became New York’s first female lawyer.\nStoneman’s unquenchable thirst for a legal education continued with her 1896 enrollment at Albany Law School. On June 2, 1898, at age 57, Stoneman became the first woman to graduate from Albany Law School. She was also the first woman to receive a bachelor’s degree from any department of Union University. Throughout her lifetime, she continued to play a prominent role in the women’s suffrage movement, participating in efforts to secure suffrage legislation in New York State. In 1918, as a poll watcher, Stoneman saw New York women vote for the first time.\n	2016-08-25 17:40:21.489983	\N	f	t	1	https://www.womenofthehall.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/kate-stoneman.jpg	
673	Harriet Beecher 	Stowe	1811	1896	https://www.womenofthehall.org/	673	Harriet Beecher Stowe was born into one of America’s most prominent religious families. The Beecher family was at the forefront of many reform movements of the 19th century.\nAfter her short teaching career, she married Calvin Stowe in 1836. In order to supplement Calvin’s teaching salary, she wrote short stories dealing with domestic life. Her royalties helped her hire household help to assist with raising their seven children.\nIn 1850 when the south threatened to secede, Stowe determined that she would write a serial denouncing the evils of slavery. She began, expecting to write three to four installments, but the novel grew to forty chapters. Meanwhile the nation became absorbed in the story. Uncle Tom’s Cabin, published in book form in 1852, was a huge success. Uncle Tom’s Cabin was the first major American novel to feature a black hero. With a fine ear for dialogue, deft humor, and dramatic plot, Stowe made her readers understand that slaves were people who were being made to suffer cruelly. Stowe’s novel also insisted that slavery undermined the moral sensibility of whites who tolerated or profited from it. Stowe wrote of the evils of slavery so that others could be free. Hers was one of the most effective pieces of reform literature ever published.\nLater her Pink and White Tyranny attacked the idea that women should be ornamental and helpless. She wrote many subsequent novels but none of her later works achieved the social impact of Uncle Tom’s Cabin.\n\n	2016-08-25 17:40:21.554972	\N	f	t	1	https://www.womenofthehall.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/harriet-beecher-stowe.jpg	
676	Harriet	Strong	1844	1926	https://www.womenofthehall.org/	676	Harriet Williams Strong was the primary innovator of dry land irrigation and water conservation techniques in late 19th century southern California. With no formal engineering or business school training, she became a renowned inventor, agricultural entrepreneur, civic leader, philanthropist, and advocate of women’s rights and women’s higher education.\nBorn in Buffalo, NY, raised in the mining towns of the California-Nevada border, she was widowed at a young age with four aughters to support. Pioneering new methods of conserving flood waters and irrigating to supply her walnut, olive and pomegranate plantings, she saved her family ranch and provided for her children. She turned her talent for invention into patents, raised fast-growing pampas grass and sold the plumes to the millinery trade. In less than five years, she rescued her family and land from debt, became the leading commercial grower of walnuts in the country and known as the Walnut Queen.\nShe tirelessly advocated for water conservation and new approaches to arid land agriculture, for the education of women, women’s independence, and for women’s suffrage, traveling across the continent with Susan B. Anthony to promote women’s causes. Mrs. Strong became the first women member of the Board of the Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce and the first woman Trustee of the University of Southern California Law School.\n\n	2016-08-25 17:40:21.599938	\N	f	t	1	https://www.womenofthehall.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/harriet-williams-russell-strong-150x150.jpg	
674	Ida 	Straus	1849	1912	http://www.woodlawnconservancy.org/	674	Ida Straus (1849– 1912) and her husband Isidor  were returning from a trip to the Riviera aboard the maiden voyage of the Titanic when it hit an iceberg in the North Atlantic. When the lifeboats were being loaded, Ida was almost persuaded to go on boat No. 8, but at the last minutes turned around and handed her fur coat to her maid and placed her in the boat. She told the bystanders that she had been with her husband for many years in life and would stay with him now. When last seen by witnesses, the devoted couple were standing on the deck holding each other in a tight embrace. They were honored at a large memorial service that drew over 6,000 people to Carnegie Hall. Since her death, Ida Strauss has often been lauded for her brave, selfless and loyal act. She is buried at Woodlawn Cemetery.	2016-08-25 17:40:21.575294	\N	f	t	1	http://aftitanic.free.fr/titanic/passagers/straus_ri_h.jpg	
692	Ida	Tarbell	1857	1944	https://www.womenofthehall.org/	692	Ida Tarbell helped transform journalism by introducing what is called today investigative journalism. Through her achievements, she not only helped to expand the role of the newspaper in modern society and stimulate the Progressive reform movement, but she also became a role model for women wishing to become professional journalists.\nBorn on the oil frontier of western Pennsylvania in 1857, Tarbell was among the first women to graduate from Allegheny College in 1880. After trying her hand at the more traditional women’s job of teaching, Tarbell began writing and editing a magazine for the Methodist Church. Then, after studying in France for a few years, she joined S. S. McClure’s new reform-minded magazine in 1894. Initially she wrote two popular biographical series–on Napoleon and Abraham Lincoln. In 1902, she embarked on her ground breaking study of John D. Rockefeller’s Standard Oil Company, or what was called the Standard Oil Trust. Her History of the Standard Oil Company, published in 1904, was a landmark work of expose journalism that became known as “muckraking.” Her exposure of Rockefeller’s unfair business methods outraged the public and led the government to prosecute the company for violations of the Sherman Anti-Trust Act. As a result, after years of precedent-setting litigation, the Supreme Court upheld the break-up of Standard Oil.\nAs the most famous woman journalist of her time, Tarbell founded the American Magazine in 1906. She authored biographies of several important businessmen and wrote a series of articles about an extremely controversial issue of her day, the tariff imposed on goods imported from foreign countries. Of this series President Wilson commented, “She has written more good sense, good plain common sense, about the tariff than any man I know of.” During World War I, she joined the efforts to improve the plight of working women. In 1922, The New York Times named her one of the “Twelve Greatest American Women.” It was journalism like hers that inspired Americans of the early twentieth century to seek reform in our government, in our economic structures, and in our urban areas. Along with other muckrakers like Lincoln Steffens, Ray Stannard Baker, and Upton Sinclair, Tarbell ushered in reform journalism. Ever since, newspapers have played a leading role as the watchdogs and consciences of our political, economic, and social lives.\nAlthough Tarbell was not, herself, an advocate of women’s issues or women’s rights, as the most prominent woman active in the muckraking movement and one of the most respected business historians of her generation, Tarbell succeeded in a “male” world,  the world of journalism, business analysis, and world affairs, thus helping to open the door to other women seeking careers in journalism and, later, in broadcasting.\n\n	2016-08-25 17:40:21.887791	\N	f	t	1	https://www.womenofthehall.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/ida-tarbell-205x298.jpg	
1089	Sophia	Smith	1796	1870		\N	Sophia Smith founded Smith College in 1870 with the substantial estate she inherited from her father, who was a wealthy farmer. Deaf since age 40 and unmarried, Smith initially considered endowing her fortune to an institute for the deaf, but changed her mind when the Clarke School for the Deaf opened in Northampton, Massachusetts in 1868. Encouraged by the Reverend John Morton Greene, she decided to endow a women's college instead. Upon her death on June 12, 1870, her fortune of $387,468 was willed to endow Smith College, which was chartered in 1871 and opened its doors in 1875 with 14 students. It marked the first founding of a women's college by a woman. She also left money for the establishment of coeducational high school in her hometown of Hatfield, Massachusetts.	2016-08-30 18:22:40.245752	\N	f	f	1	https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e8/Sophia_Smith_late_1860s.jpg	\N

According to Elaine Kim, a professor in Asian American studies at the University of California-Berkeley, Tape waged a campaign for Chinese children's access to public education, and even took it to court. In Tape v. Hurley (1885), a judge ruled that public education be accessible for Chinese children. Sadly, the school denied Tape's daughter entry again on the grounds that she didn't have her vaccinations. Still, Tape fought to end school segregation -- and made headway – several decades before the monumental Brown v.

678	Anne	Sullivan	1866	1936	https://www.womenofthehall.org/	678	Anne Sullivan lost her mother when she was young and her father became an alcoholic. She and her siblings were sent to live with relatives, but in 1876 the family sent Annie and her youngest brother to the Tewksbury, Massachusetts poorhouse. There she lost her sight to trachoma. After four years, she was sent to the Perkins School for the Blind in Boston and eventually received medical treatment that restored her sight.\nUpon graduation from Perkins in 1886, she began to teach. The next year, the Headmaster of Perkins wrote to her about the situation of a student who was blind and deaf, unable to communicate and demonstrating violent temper tantrums. No one had been successful in reaching her. Anne Sullivan rose to the challenge and traveled to Alabama to meet Helen Keller.\nSullivan had learned the manual alphabet and immediately began to teach Keller by letting her touch things. Sullivan would then spell what the object was in Keller’s hand. Sullivan succeeded in teaching Keller to read, write and minimally speak. In 1904, Keller graduated from Radcliffe College, supported by Sullivan’s presence.\nSullivan and Keller became world famous through Keller’s writing, lectures and other public appearances. Sullivan’s dedication and innovative teaching had made it possible for Keller to break through the formidable barriers that challenged people with multiple disabilities. Both became role models for thousands of physically challenged people around the world and raised thousands of dollars for organizations that assisted the blind.\nSullivan’s focus, persistence, and creativity forged a model that contributed to changing public perceptions regarding the capabilities of people with disabilities. Her insight and dedication contributed to the contemporary expansion of opportunities for people with disabilities and to breaking down myths and stereotypes, furthering social and economic justice.\n\n	2016-08-25 17:40:21.64175	\N	f	t	1	https://www.womenofthehall.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/anne-sullivan.jpg	
1090	Alberta O.	Jones	1930	1965		1063	Alberta Odell Jones was one the first African-American women to pass the Kentucky bar, and was the first female city attorney in Jefferson County.  She was appointed in February 1965 to be a prosecutor in Louisville Domestic Relations Court, and was murdered in August of that year. Jones was a graduate of Louisville Central High School and attended the Louisville Municipal College for African Americans. When the college was merged with the University of Louisville (U of L) during desegregation, Jones continued her education at U of L and graduated third in her class. She was accepted into the University of Louisville Law School but transferred after the first year to Howard University School of Law, where she graduated fourth in her class. After law school, Jones started her own law office, located at 2018 W. Broadway, and at one point represented a young boxer named Cassius Clay.  She took Clay—now known as Muhammad Ali—to California to be trained under Archie Moore. Jones was also active in the Louisville civil rights movement.  After participating in the March on Washington and the marches in Louisville, she rented voting machines and held classes to teach African Americans how to vote for the candidate of their choice. She established the Independent Voters Association and was an active member of the Louisville Urban League and the NAACP. She also established the James "Bulky" Welch Fund and held a fund-raiser, raffling off a car to pay Welch's medical bills and purchase the prosthetic arms to replace the ones young Welch had lost trying to retrieve his dog from under a train. Sometime in the early hours of August 5, 1965, someone murdered Alberta Jones and tossed her body off Louisville’s Sherman Minton Bridge, into the waters of the Ohio River.   Police at the time attributed her death to drowning, but an autopsy also indicated she had received several serious blows to her head before she entered the water.	2016-08-30 18:27:52.192258	\N	f	t	1	http://kulturekritic.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/12/AlbertaJones22565w.jpg	\N

V. Switzer’.   After the race began, the race director realized Switzer was a woman and attempted to forcibly remove her.  However, she continued on and completed the course.  Photos of this “Boston Incident” ignited the women’s running revolution at a time when popular theory held that women were not strong enough to run the 26.2 mile distance.\nThanks to the efforts of Switzer and others, women were officially allowed into road races in 1971. The next year, she earned her M.A. in public communications from Syracuse University.\nIn 1977, Switzer founded the Avon International Running Circuit, an initiative that created running programs in 27 countries for over 1 million women.  These efforts eventually led to the inclusion of the women’s marathon as an official event in the Olympic Games.  In 1984, 49 athletes from 28 countries ran the inaugural Women’s Olympic Marathon.\nSwitzer went on to simultaneous careers as a fitness expert, television broadcaster, author and public speaker.  She formed her own company, AtAlanta Sports Promotions and is an Emmy Award-winning television commentator who has done broadcast work for ABC, CBS, NBC and ESPN.  Switzer’s books include Marathon Woman and Running and Walking for Women Over 40.\nSwitzer has revolutionized the sport of running for women, while at the same time increasing awareness of healthy lifestyles and the importance of fitness.  She once noted that, “Triumph over adversity, that’s what the marathon is all about. Nothing in life can’t triumph after that.”\nA member of the inaugural class of the National Distance Running Hall of Fame (1998), Switzer was named one of four “Visionaries of the Century” by Runner’s World Magazine (2002), and has received the Abebe Bikila Award from the New York Road Runners Club for her global contribution to running (2003).\nStill recognized as a leader in the running world, Switzer has completed over thirty-seven marathons and dedicated her career to creating opportunities and equal sport status for women.\n\n	2016-08-25 17:40:21.699786	\N	f	t	1	https://www.womenofthehall.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/kathrine-switzer-205x247.jpg	
683	Henrietta	Szold	1860	1945	https://www.womenofthehall.org/	683	Educator and social activist Henrietta Szold is best known as the founder of Hadassah, the Women’s Zionist Organization of America, Inc. Szold was born in Baltimore, Maryland in 1860. The oldest daughter of a well-known rabbi, Henrietta was given a well-rounded education both by her parents and at Western High School. Upon her graduation in 1877, having achieved an outstanding academic record, she began teaching at a Baltimore girls” school. For the next fifteen years she taught a broad range of subjects, including languages, mathematics, and history.\nAlso during this time, she developed a night school program to help newly arrived immigrants learn English and civics. By 1898, more than 5,000 Jewish and non-Jewish immigrants had attended the program, which had been taken over by the city of Baltimore. In addition, in 1893 Szold became the first full-time secretary of the Jewish Publication Society of America, a position she held for twenty-three years, with duties similar to the position of editor-in-chief.\nIn 1909, she and her 70-year old mother spent six months traveling around Palestine. This trip became a major turning point in Szold’s life. Impressed by the beauty of the countryside, but appalled by the overwhelming conditions of poverty and disease, she returned to the U.S. determined to make a difference in pre-state Israel.\nIn 1912 she founded Hadassah (from the Biblical name for Queen Esther, one of the greatest Jewish heroines), which has since become one of the largest American women’s social action organizations. The organization is credited with having had a profound effect on the establishment of life-changing medical, educational, and social practices in pre-state Israel. The American Zionist Medical Unit, founded by Hadassah in 1916, sent doctors, nurses, and supplies to the area, completely transforming health care in the region.\nIn 1920, Szold returned to Palestine to help the AZMU and spent most of the next twenty-five years there. During this time, her last significant and possibly most important achievement occurred; Szold directed Youth Aliyah, which brought more than 11,000 young people from the threats of Nazi Europe to pre-state Israel. This effort, as much as anything Szold did in her 84 years of social activism, bore witness to her oft-repeated phrase, “make my eyes look toward the future.”\n\n	2016-08-25 17:40:21.72213	\N	f	t	1	https://www.womenofthehall.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/henrietta-szold.jpg

Because of her gender, Temple-Wood said she’s been subject to a constant bombardment of harassment. Online trolls frequently contact her soliciting dates and “sexual favors.” They condescendingly discuss her body, and insult her with profanities and sexist comments. Instead of ignoring the misogyny or engaging the trolls, the 21-year-old molecular biology student at Loyola University in Chicago decided to turn the negativity into an opportunity for empowerment. For every harassing email she receives, Temple-Wood has vowed to write a Wikipedia article about a woman scientist. Back in 2012, Temple-Wood co-founded WikiProject Women Scientists, an initiative dedicated to ensuring that women in science were adequately represented on Wikipedia. Temple-Wood’s WikiProject was a huge success. According to a Wikimedia blog post this week, the initiative helped more than 370 women scientists appear on Wikipedia’s front page “Did you know?” section. 	2016-08-30 18:32:28.771877	\N	f	t	1	https://bluestockingorg.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/emily-temple-wood.png	\N

686	Mary Burnett 	Talbert	1866	1923	https://www.womenofthehall.org/	686	Mary Burnett Talbert, civil rights and anti-lynching activist, suffragist, preservationist, international human rights proponent, and educator, was born, raised and educated in Oberlin, Ohio. Upon receiving her college degree from Oberlin, she accepted a position as a high school teacher in Little Rock, Arkansas, where she taught science, history, math, and Latin at the high school and then at Bethel University.\nIn 1887, she was named assistant principal of Little Rock’s Union High School, the only African American woman to hold such a position and the highest position held by a woman in Arkansas. Mary Burnett married William Talbert in 1891 and moved with him to Buffalo, NY. She was a founding member of the Phyllis Wheatley Club, the first in Buffalo to affiliate with the National Association of Colored Women’s Clubs. The Club established a settlement house and helped organize the first chapter of the NAACP (1910). In 1901, Talbert founded the Christian Culture Club at the Michigan Avenue Baptist Church.\nTalbert also protested the exclusion of African Americans from the Planning Committee of the Pan-American Exposition. She was instrumental in the founding of the Niagara Movement, pre-cursor to the NAACP (1905). Mrs. Talbert’s club connections were extensive. In her NACW Presidential years, she transformed the association into a truly national institution with structure and organizational procedures. Its first national undertaking was the 1922 purchase and restoration of the Frederick Douglass home in Anacostia, MD. She was elected president for life of the Frederick Douglass Memorial and Historical Association.\nOn the international scene, she served as a Red Cross nurse during World War I in France, sold thousands of dollars of Liberty Bonds during the war, offered classes to African American soldiers and was a member of the Women’s Committee of National Defense. After the war, she was appointed to the Women’s Committee on International Relations, which selected women nominees for position in the League of Nations.\nMrs. Talbert was a pioneer in international organizing efforts, gaining a voice for African American women and developing black female leadership. With conscious intent, she bridged the generation of 19th century abolitionists and freedom seekers: Tubman, Douglass, Truth, and others, and the developing civil rights leadership of the 20th century. Addressing the Fifth Congress of the International Council of Women, Christiana, Norway, 1920, where she was the first African-American delegate, Talbert said, “the greatness of nations is shown by their strict regard for human rights, rigid enforcement of the law without bias, and just administration of the affairs of life.”\n\n	2016-08-25 17:40:21.787198	\N	f	t	1	https://www.womenofthehall.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/mary-burnett-talbert-205x299.jpg	
689	Maria	Tallchief	1925	2013	https://www.womenofthehall.org/	689	One of the premiere American ballerinas of all time, Maria Tallchief has been recognized as one of the greatest dancers in the world. She said of her passion, “A ballerina takes steps given to her and makes them her own. Each individual brings something different to the same role.”\nTallchief was born in Fairfax, Oklahoma, on the Osage Indian Reservation, and began ballet and piano lessons at the age of three. Her family soon relocated to California, where she began to devote more of her time to dancing. By the age of 12, she was studying with notable teacher Bronislava Nijinska, and upon her graduation from high school, she joined the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo. Over the next five years, Tallchief attracted much attention with memorable performances, particularly of the works of choreographer George Balanchine.\nAfter marrying Balanchine in 1946, the couple left the Ballet Russe and moved to Paris, France, where Tallchief became the first American ballerina to debut at the Paris Opera. Soon after, Tallchief and Balanchine formed the Balanchine Ballet Society, now known as the New York City Ballet. At the ballet, Tallchief became the first American dancer to achieve the title of prima ballerina, a title she held for 18 years. Among her most significant roles were Symphomie Concatenate, Orpheus, The Firebird, Scotch Symphony, Caracole, Swan Lake and The Nutcracker.\nFollowing her retirement from ballet in 1965, Tallchief served as artistic director of the Chicago Lyric Opera Ballet (1975). In 1980, she founded the Chicago City Ballet, where she served as the artistic director until 1987. When the State of Oklahoma honored Tallchief in 1953, she was given the name of Wa-Xthe-Thomba, meaning “Woman of Two Worlds,” a name that celebrates her international achievements as a prima ballerina and Native American. Tallchief was presented with a National Medal of the Arts award by the National Endowment for the Arts in 1999.\nTallchief’s legendary artistic style and excellence continues to inspire dancers worldwide.\n\n	2016-08-25 17:40:21.844479	\N	f	t	1	https://www.womenofthehall.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/maria-tallchief-205x239.jpg

Her father became the most important influence in her early years, and he encouraged her professional goals. Excluded from Harvard Medical School because of her sex, she went to Johns Hopkins instead and became interested in the field of cardiology.\nAs chief of the heart clinic at Johns Hopkins she regularly saw children born with heart defects. The most pathetic were the cyanotic, or “blue babies,” condemned to invalidism and early death. Dr. Taussig began to theorize about the nature of the anatomical defects involved, and to devise possible surgical solutions.\nTogether with a heart surgeon named Blalock, she pioneered the Blalock-Taussig operation, first performed in 1944. The first patient was a one-year old child who weighed just 10 pounds. Dr. Taussig had the thrill of seeing the child develop a healthy pink color for the first time. The operation soon became widely performed. Her medical breakthrough combined caring and inventiveness, and many infants won the chance for a normal life.\n\n	2016-08-25 17:40:21.915019	\N	f	t	1	https://www.womenofthehall.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/helen-brooke-taussig-150x150.jpg

Her early childhood was spent on a New York estate owned by a Dutch American named Colonel Johannes Hardenbergh.... she experienced the miseries of being sold and was cruelly beaten and mistreated... In 1827, after her master failed to honor his promise to free her or to uphold the New York Anti-Slavery Law of 1827, Isabella ran away, or, as she later informed her master, 'I did not run away, I walked away by daylight….' After experiencing a religious conversion, Isabella became an itinerant preacher and in 1843 changed her name to Sojourner Truth. During this period she became involved in the growing antislavery movement, and by the 1850s she was involved in the woman’s rights movement as well. At the 1851 Women’s Rights Convention held in Akron, Ohio, Sojourner Truth delivered what is now recognized as one of the most famous abolitionist and women’s rights speeches in American history, 'Ain’t I a Woman?' She continued to speak out for the rights of African Americans and women during and after the Civil War. Sojourner Truth died in Battle Creek, Michigan, in 1883."

Five years after her marriage, she fled Philadelphia and escaped slavery. Tubman did not stop there; she went back to the South to rescue her family members and other slaves. Tubman made over 19 trips, during a ten year period, as a conductor of the Underground Railroad and guided over 300 slaves to freedom. According to Bruce Dearstyne’s article “Harriet Tubman: the Long Road to the $20 Bill” Tubman traveled with her escaping slaves at night, using the North Star for guidance, usually taking them to freedom in Pennsylvania or New York and often to Canada, then a British colony where slavery was prohibited. \nTubman, also known as Moses, was proud of never losing a slave or failing to get to the North safely. Tubman became well-known that by 1856 Southern slave owners were offering $40,000 reward for her capture. Her activism also included supporting the women’s suffrage movement by giving speeches, in New York, Boston, and Washington D.C. She was named an American hero by President Barack Obama. As a part of saving her legacy and civil rights efforts, the Treasury Secretary Jack Lew announced in April 2016 that Harriet Tubman will be featured on the front of new $20 bills. Tubman is the first woman to appear on modern U.S. currency. She displaces former president Andrew Jackson, whose image will move to the back of the bill.

708	Sojourner	Truth	1797	1883	https://www.womenofthehall.org/	708	Sojourner Truth was born a slave named Isabella in Ulster County, New York. After slavery was finally abolished in New York, she found refuge with a Quaker family named Van Wagener and took their name. Isabella Van Wagener was caught up in the atmosphere of religious excitement then sweeping American Protestantism. She did missionary work among the poor of New York City and was associated briefly with a Christian community headed by a dynamic leader who turned out to be a scoundrel. In 1843 she set out on her own as a traveling preacher. God, she said, had given her a new name: Sojourner Truth.\nAs was common in that era, religious fervor led her into association with reformers who hoped to create a better world. Tall, gaunt, and commanding, she lent her powerful talents as a speaker to the antislavery movement. When she happened upon a women’s rights convention, she made that her cause as well. Illiterate all her life, she spoke more often among whites than her own people. Her homely eloquence and native wit disarmed hostile crowds.\nAt the Civil War’s end she worked as counselor to the newly freed slaves who gathered in Washington. Hoping to aid in their transition to freedom, she circulated a petition for public lands to be set aside in the West for a “Negro state.” She continued to speak, proclaiming God’s love and the rights of the disadvantaged.\n\n	2016-08-25 17:40:22.133538	\N	f	f	1	https://www.womenofthehall.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/sojourner-truth-205x282.jpg

After the war, she taught nursing at Yale and eventually became Dean of Yale’s prestigious School of Nursing. Her most lasting impact was bringing the HOSPICE movement to the United States from Europe. Learning of the HOSPICE movement, Wald went to Europe, studied the movement, and then, in 1971, returned to the United States to establish the first HOSPICE unit in this country. Since then, the movement has spread rapidly because of the great need it fulfills. HOSPICE, now a household name, has made it possible for tens of thousands to die at home surrounded by loved ones and friends.\nThroughout the remainder of her life, Wald continued her work with HOSPICE to ensure that services were available to all. She was also instrumental in bringing HOSPICE to prisons in the state of Connecticut.\n\n	2016-08-25 17:40:22.311548	\N	f	t	1	https://www.womenofthehall.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/florence-wald-150x150.jpg	
722	Gertrude	Waldeyer	1908	1987	www.nycgovparks.org/	722	Gertrude Waldeyer was an active member of the Bayside community. Born in Brooklyn, Waldeyer studied at Hunter College and later received her Master of Arts from Queens College. After marrying in 1931, she moved to Bayside, where she became an educator and environmentalist.\n\nWaldeyer worked as a teacher and administrator at Bayside High School, and was a member of Community Board 11 and the Bayside Historical Society. She is remembered most for organizing a grass-roots effort to preserve Oakland Lake for future generations through the Oakland Lake and Ravine Conservation Committee, which she helped found.\n\nIn the 1930s, Works Project Administration (WPA) workers lined the brook feeding Oakland Lake with blocks, and later, the brook and a small pond leading into the lake were filled. In 1941 officials from the Sanitation and Health Departments worked with WPA workers to fill in nearby wetlands in an attempt to control the mosquito population. Three thousand people were put to work at nine Queens sites laying pipes, digging drainage ditches, and filling in and grading low areas. The result was the destruction of the area’s fragile marshland ecosystem. As Queens grew, encroaching urbanization also threatened the lake. The construction of a nearby school, the Queensborough Community College, and the widening of Springfield Boulevard on the lake’s western shore all took their toll on the lake’s health.\n\nIn the 1960s, community groups, citing Alley Pond’s rich cultural and environmental history, started a campaign to restore Alley Pond Park. Residents suffered through urban planning that carved Bayside in two with highways and parkways that cut off the neighborhood from the waterfront along Little Neck Bay. In response to these changes in her community, Waldeyer crusaded passionately on behalf of Oakland Lake’s wildlife and woodlands.\n\nIn 1969, 2,000 people participated in a “Walk in the Alley” led by the Alley Restoration Committee. This group, which called for the improvement of natural resources like Oakland Lake, met with Parks Commissioner August Heckscher (1913–1997) and secured a commitment from Parks to speed up plans to rehabilitate the area. In 1972, Parks stabilized the slopes in the hills around the lake to control erosion and constructed a path and sitting area around the lake.\n\nIn 1987, the year of Waldeyer’s death, Parks spent nearly $1 million to restore Oakland Lake to its natural state. Parks planted new trees and shrubs to rebuild the depleted forest around the lake and began a program to reduce erosion around the lake’s shores. Before she died, Waldeyer helped map parts of the site that would qualify as freshwater wetlands under the New York State Freshwater Act (1975). In 1988, the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation designated the Oakland Lake area a Significant Habitat, buttressing the Oakland Lake Committee and Waldeyer’s efforts to protect the lake.\n\nIn 1989, the lake’s promenade was named for Waldeyer at a ceremony attended by Waldeyer’s family, her colleagues from Bayside High School, and other preservationists. Waldeyer’s associates in the battle to restore the lake remembered her as someone who would rush out of her home in her nightgown at the sound of chainsaws threatening the environment. Waldeyer’s relatives recalled that even when she was too frail to leave her home, Waldeyer often looked out her bedroom window to gaze at “her glacial lake.”\n\nOne of the many wonderful, natural features in Alley Pond Park, the rescued and rehabilitated Oakland Lake is a perfect example of the strength of neighborhood and grassroots efforts to preserve the City’s precious natural environments. The Gertrude Waldeyer Promenade is a fitting tribute to a local hero who defended this beautiful site.	2016-08-25 17:40:22.375627	\N	f	t	1		
723	Mary Edwards 	Walker	1832	1919	https://www.womenofthehall.org/	723	Mary Edwards Walker, M.D., physician and Civil War field surgeon, was the first woman to receive the Medal of Honor.\nMuch ahead of her time, Dr. Walker, in 1855, was one of the first women in the United States to earn a medical degree. When the Civil War broke out in 1861, Dr. Walker volunteered to work on the Civil War battlefields caring for the wounded. Denied a commission as a medical officer because she was a woman, she volunteered anyway and eventually was appointed assistant surgeon of the 52nd Ohio Infantry. Captured by the Confederates in 1864, she was exchanged only after she spent four months in a Richmond, Virginia prison.\nDr. Walker lived a controversial life. She lectured throughout the United States and abroad on women’s rights, dress reform, health and temperance issues, and sexual and political equality. She tried to vote, but was turned away. She rejected corsets and hoop-skirted dresses for the more practical pantsuits (trousers, jackets, top hats) and found herself arrested in New York City for impersonating a man. She spoke against imperialism, the Spanish-American War, and America’s acquisition of colonies abroad. She worked for equal rights in all facets of life, from love and marriage to the workplace. She urged the reform of divorce laws that placed women in deplorable situations. She advocated women retaining their own surnames. Much to the horror of her contemporaries, she foresaw that a time would come when men and women would keep their own names when they married and that the children of these alliances would choose the name they preferred. She also authored two books devoted to her views on feminism.\nShe struggled on the brink of poverty as she lost work because of her refusal to bow to the will of others or to follow standard operating procedures. She was ridiculed for many of her ideas and assertive manner. Her Medal of Honor was revoked. Today, society recognizes her achievements and her insistence that women be treated with the same respect as men. And in 1977, the Army Board, admitting that Dr. Walker had been a victim of sex discrimination, restored the Medal of Honor to her, citing her for “distinguished gallantry, self-sacrifice, patriotism, dedication and unflinching loyalty to her country.”\n\n	2016-08-25 17:40:22.386547	\N	f	t	1	https://www.womenofthehall.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/mary-edwards-walker-150x150.jpg

After they were married they lived on a 75 acre farm in Humphries, Missouri, a tiny town which had about 160 people (today there are less than100). Humpfies is one of the poorest counties in the country. The farm had an outhouse where you filled a bucket of water to wash down the waste. When my grandmother was about 80 a dog attacked and killed the chickens on the farm. My grandmother plucked the feathers from all the chicken and used them for dinner so as not to let them go to waste. When she was about 80 a dog died on her property and froze.

732	Mercy Otis 	Warren	1728	1814	https://www.womenofthehall.org/	732	Mercy Otis Warren was a staunch advocate of independence from the tyranny of 18th century English monarchic rule. As poet, dramatist, satirist, and historian, her voice was one of the early calls in America for revolt against the British and their policies as implemented by Governor Thomas Hutchinson.\nBorn in West Barnstable, MA, the third of thirteen children born to James (elected to the Massachusetts House of Representatives in 1745), and Mary Otis, Mercy Otis Warren had no formal education. She was tutored, along with her older brother James, by a local pastor. James Otis shared her political beliefs and became a leader in the agitation against the Stamp Act of 1765. Mercy Otis read intensively, particularly Shakespeare, Pope and Raleigh and applied her literary background and talent in the service of the patriotic cause. She was a friend of Abigail and John Adams, and corresponded with both throughout her life. Her husband, James Warren, a member of the Massachusetts House of Representatives, was an outspoken revolutionary activist. These connections gave Mercy Otis Warren a political involvement highly unusual for a woman of her time.\nFrom 1765 to 1789, she was near the center of revolutionary political events in Massachusetts. It is believed that her 1788 pamphlet “Observations on the New Constitution‚” played a role in the design and adoption of the Bill of Rights. She wrote letters, poems and a series of satirical plays: The Adulateur, The Defeat, and The Group, regarded as the first plays by an American woman. The plays focused on the Tory government in Massachusetts, particularly that of Governor Hutchinson, accusing him of gross ambition and hypocrisy, simultaneously making an outstanding defense for the revolutionary cause. The plays were printed, not staged. Puritan Boston prohibited staging plays. In 1805, after twenty-five years of research and writing, her three volume History of the Rise, Progress and Termination of the American Revolution appeared. Her History contains knowledgeable and unique observations concerning the events, leaders and campaigns of the period, and is the only full-scale history of the American Revolution written by a woman of the time.\nWarren wrote in her preface: “every domestic enjoyment depends on the unimpaired possession of civil and religious liberty.”\n	2016-08-25 17:40:22.540936	\N	f	t	1	https://www.womenofthehall.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/mercy-otis-warren-150x150.jpg

726	Alice Malsenior 	Walker	1944		http://www.acf.hhs.gov/programs/ohs	726	Alice Malsenior Walker is an American novelist, short story writer, poet, and activist. She is well-known for writing “The Color Purple” in 1982, for which she won the National Book Award and the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction. The novel follows a young troubled black woman fighting her way through not just racist white culture, but patriarchal black culture as well. Alice worked as writer in residence at Jackson State College (1968–69) and Tougaloo College (1970–71) and was a consultant in black history to the Friends of the Children of Mississippi Head Start program. In 1984, Walker and her fellow writer Robert L. Allen found “Wild Tree Press”, a feminist publishing company in Anderson Valley, California. She is also a leading figure in liberal politics. Walker met Martin Luther King Jr. when she was a student at Spelman College in the early 1960s. She credits King for her decision to return to the American South as a civil rights activist. She took part in the 1963 March on Washington. Later, she volunteered to register black voters in Georgia and Mississippi. On March 8, 2003, Walker was arrested with 26 others crossing a police line during an anti-Iraq war rally outside the White House on Women’ International Day. In an interview with Democracy Now, Walker said, "I was with other women who believe that the women and children of Iraq are just as dear as the women and children in our families, and that, in fact, we are one family. And so it would have felt to me that we were going over to actually bomb ourselves”. Walker's feminism specifically included advocacy of women of color. In 1983, Walker coined the term "womanism" to mean "Black feminism". The term was made to unite colored feminists under one term. She said, "Womanism" gives us a word of our own.”	2016-08-25 17:40:22.442439	\N	f	t	1	http://deepsouthmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/alice-walker.jpg	http://www.biography.com/people/alice-walker-9521939/videos/alice-walker-pursuing-civil-rights-11994179953

While taught Navajo history and culture, Wauneka also gained a general education. When she was eight, while attending a government-run school on the reservation, a tragic event occurred that helped shape the rest of her life. An influenza epidemic struck. Thousands of Navajos, including many of Wauneka’s classmates, died. Wauneka escaped with only a mild case that left her resistant to the disease. Thus she was able to care for those who were too ill to feed themselves. After graduation and her marriage to George Wauneka, Annie continued to travel with her father, observing the poverty and disease that plagued most of the Navajo. She studied public health and then, realizing that the best way to change the standards of health and sanitation among tribal members was from within, Wauneka gained election in 1951 to the Tribal Council, the second woman ever so elected.\nDuring her three terms in office, Wauneka led the fight against tuberculosis. She wrote a dictionary to translate English words into Navajo for modern medical techniques, such as vaccination. Her weekly radio broadcasts, in the Navajo language, explained how modern medicine could help improve health among the Navajo. She also worked on other health problems including better care for pregnant women and new babies, regular eye and ear examinations, and alcoholism. She continued working in her community on health issues until her death in 1997. She helped improve housing and sanitation conditions and convinced her tribe to adopt many modern medical practices and avail themselves of hospital care, when needed. She also served on the advisory boards of the U.S. Surgeon General and the U.S. Public Health Service.\nIn 1963, Wauneka became the first Native American to receive the Presidential Medal of Freedom. Ladies’ Home Journal selected her a Woman of the Year in 1976. In 1984, the Navajo Council designated her “The Legendary Mother of the Navajo Nation.” All recognize that through her efforts in education and health, the lives of every Navajo, as well as the nation at large, have been improved.\n\n	2016-08-25 17:40:22.632926	\N	f	t	1	https://www.womenofthehall.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/annie-dodge-wauneka-150x150.jpg

741	Angelina Grimké 	Weld	1805	1879	https://www.womenofthehall.org/	741	Sarah and Angelina Grimke eloquently fought the injustices of slavery, racism and sexism during the mid-19th century. As daughters of a prominent South Carolina judge and plantation owner, the Grimke sisters witnessed the suffering of slaves.\nDetermined to speak out, they were eventually forced to move to the North, where they continued to appeal to northerners and southerners to work toward abolition. They also urged white northerners to end racial discrimination.\nThe Grimke sisters were pioneering women. Among the first female abolitionists, they were the first women to speak publicly against slavery, an important political topic. Faced with criticism from clergy and others that they were threatening “the female character,” they continued their crusade.\nIn 1838, Angelina became the first woman to address a legislative body when she spoke to the Massachusetts State Legislature on women’s rights and abolition. Active in the women’s movement, they helped set the agenda later followed by Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Susan B. Anthony, Lucretia Mott and others, calling for equal educational opportunities and the vote.\nOne historian said of Sarah’s writings: “[They were] a milestone on the road to the Woman’s Rights Convention at Seneca Falls” and “central to the feminist writings in the decades that followed.” Sarah was one of the first to compare the restrictions on women and slaves, writing that “woman has no political existence . . . . She is only counted like the slaves of the south, to swell the number of lawmakers.”\nAfter the Civil War, they continued to champion the causes of equality and women’s rights. Through their examples and their words, the Grimke sisters proved that women could affect the course of political events and have a far-reaching influence on society.\n	2016-08-25 17:40:22.681356	\N	f	t	1	https://www.womenofthehall.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/angelina-grimk-weld-150x150.jpg

As the Founder of the Alpha Suffrage Club in her hometown Chicago, she was a fierce advocate for women's rights including voting rights.\n\nHer major work was documenting, analyzing and providing commentary on the lynchings in the U.S.A. Her book - "The Red Record" - is just that: a record of the blood soaking the earth following the brutal lynchings of thousands of primarily black men.\n\nShe inspires me because she was a feminist before her time.

Her work teaches us about ourselves and about the human spirit. She captures the distinctive southern character, enduring in the midst of change. She helps us understand women’s views of both themselves and the men around them. Thus she illuminates the complicated interrelationships between men and women. She teaches us that the search for meaning often proves complex, multiple, and elusive. Her Pulitzer Prize-winning novel, The Optimist’s Daughter, sees the old civilities of small town Mississippi, along with its snobbishness and sense of privilege, collide with the materialistic values of the modern, outside world. In the novel, Welty analyzes other confrontations and their meaning, such as death and love. She also examines the interdependence of children and their parents.\nHer writing has been recognized with numerous awards, including the French Legion of Honor, the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the American Book Award, the National Book Critics Award, the O. Henry Award, the Commonwealth Award for Distinguished Service in Literature from the Modern Language Association of America, along with honorary degrees from many leading universities.\nThrough her short stories and novels, Welty has made a lasting impact on our lives and our understanding of love between men and women, the fleeting joys of childhood, and the many dimensions and stages of women’s lives.\n\n	2016-08-25 17:40:22.735223	\N	f	t	1	https://www.womenofthehall.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/eudora-welty-150x150.jpg

752	Emma Hart 	Willard	1787	1870	https://www.womenofthehall.org/	752	A pioneer in women’s education, Emma Hart Willard founded Troy Female Seminary, the first school for young women in the United States.\nmma Hart was the sixteenth of seventeen children, born in Berlin, Connecticut, to a family that valued education.  Her mother was literate at a time when very few women in New England could read and write, and her father believed in educating his daughters as well as his sons.  Hart attended local schools and began her teaching career in 1804.  In 1807, she moved to Middlebury, Vermont to manage a women’s academy.\nTwo years later, she married John Willard and, as was customary, she retired from teaching for a period of time.  In 1814, Willard returned to her profession and opened a girls’ school in her home.  Struck by the contrast between the education she could offer her students and the curriculum provided to young men at a nearby college, she wrote A Plan for Improving Female Education.  The document advocated equal education for young women through the academy level.\nAt the encouragement of Governor DeWitt Clinton, Willard moved to New York in 1819 and opened a school in Waterford.  In 1821, she relocated again, to Troy, and opened Troy Female Seminary.  Renamed the Emma Willard School in her honor in 1895, the school saw thousands of young women pass through its doors during Willard’s lifetime.\nIn 1838, Willard left daily management of the school to her son and daughter-in-law and spent the last 30 years of her life traveling and writing.  She returned often to the school, entertaining students in her house at the edge of the grounds, or even filling the role of principal as needed.\nAt the time of her death in 1870, Willard was proclaimed the best known woman in America.  Since its founding, the Emma Willard School has been one of the nation’s leading schools for young women.\n\n	2016-08-25 17:40:22.848165	\N	f	t	1	https://www.womenofthehall.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/emma-hart-willard-150x150.jpg

Willard	1839	1898	https://www.womenofthehall.org/	753	After graduating from North Western Female College in 1859, Willard became a leading educator, teaching at a number of schools in Illinois, Pennsylvania, and New York before becoming, in 1871, the first female president of a college granting degrees to women – the newly-formed Evanston College for Ladies. After the college merged with Northwestern University, Willard became the first Dean of Women and Professor of Aesthetics. In 1873, she helped found the Association for the Advancement of Women.\nWillard left education for work in temperance in 1874. In that year, the Woman’s Christian Temperance Union (WCTU) was founded with Willard as the first corresponding secretary. In 1879, she would become its second president. For Willard, the WCTU was an effective school for women, giving them a chance to achieve identities beyond those of wives and mothers. The WCTU, with Willard was president, became the largest organization of women in the United States. At WCTU meetings, women followed parliamentary procedures; they assumed leadership roles and learned to use their skills to achieve many different goals. Willard, herself, traveled throughout the nation, lectured, wrote books, and edited WCTU publications. In 1883, Willard helped found the World’s Woman’s Christian Temperance Union.\nWillard also influenced the suffrage movement. She urged suffragists to work on the local level to achieve the vote rather than focus all their energies on a constitutional amendment. Such a strategy won numerous gains. Moreover, Willard convinced many reluctant women to support the suffrage movement, so they could use the power of the vote to make and keep their towns dry and improve the moral fiber of America.\nIn addition to temperance and suffrage, under Willard’s leadership the WCTU supported broad social reforms such as equal pay for equal work, the eight-hour work day, Armenian relief, world peace, the protection of women and children in the workplace, kindergartens, mothers’ clubs (the forerunner of the PTA), dress reform, jail reform, uniform marriage and divorce laws, and physical education in grade schools. The WCTU established homes for working girls, shelters for abused women and children, and free kindergartens. In addition, Willard was a founding member of the Illinois Woman’s Press Association, one of the first five women elected to the Methodist General Conference, and a founder and first president of the National Council of Women.\nFor nineteen years as WCTU president, Willard promoted unlimited aspirations for women: higher education, choice of vocation, and equality of opportunity along with suffrage and temperance.\n\n	2016-08-25 17:40:22.861479	\N	f	t	1	https://www.womenofthehall.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/frances-e-willard-150x150.jpg

764	Agnes	Wong			Labor Arts	764	Agnes Wong was an activist in the International Ladies’ Garment Workers Union for more than 30 years. Born in Guangzhou, China, she moved to Hong Kong as a child and came to New York with her husband in 1974. Shortly after arriving, she took a job working as a seamstress in a garment factory in Chinatown and joined Local 23–25 ILGWU. She walked out of her factory with 20,000 of her co-workers in the 1982 Chinatown Garment Factory Strike, and later became a shop representative and a Local 23-25 Executive Board member.\n\nShe credits the union with ‘bringing her up’—she met strong women leaders, and learned English, leadership development, and organizing. The union, in return, benefited from Agnes’ activism. Over the years, she helped organize Chinese speaking workers in various industries in the US and in Canada. Completely bi-lingual, she represented the union in the media and by lobbying government officials on human and workers’ rights, fighting against free trade agreements and sweatshops in the garment industry, and by educating the public about the Triangle factory fire and its legacy. Wong is currently Vice President of the Local 23-25 Chinese Retirees Club, which engages its 500 members in political, educational and recreational activities.\n\nA founding member of the Chinese Committee of the Coalition of Labor Union Women and the Asian Pacific American Labor Alliance, Agnes is active in many communities. As a committed member of the Transfiguration Catholic Church she provides support to those who feel isolated, regularly visiting the sick and ailing. “As an immigrant to the US who knows no one,” she explains, “you feel distressed. That is why it’s so important to support each other.”\n\n\n	2016-08-25 17:40:23.069697	\N	f	t	1		
765	Victoria	Woodhull	1838	1927	https://www.womenofthehall.org/	765	Victoria Woodhull was a passionate campaigner for social justice who combined deep belief in Spiritualism, radical views on achieving equal rights for women, advocacy of divorce law changes, birth control, working people’s rights, and tax reform as her platform for change. She was the first American woman to address Congress and the first to run for the office of President of the United States.\nOvercoming childhood poverty, abuse and exploitation, Woodhull supported her family by working as a medium and fortuneteller. Her success as a clairvoyant connected her with Cornelius Vanderbilt. His backing made it possible for Mrs. Woodhull and her sister Tennessee Claflin to own and operate a brokerage firm and publish the highly successful Woodhull & Claflin’s Weekly.\nWoodhull’s charisma, sense of mission, incisiveness, wealth, and independence made it possible for her to briefly reinvigorate the women’s movement. Many of Woodhull’s views and themes were prophetic of issues and debates of the twentieth century. Stanton and Anthony at first embraced Woodhull but drew back as her extreme critiques of marriage and America’s class disparities, involvement in flamboyant scandals, and “free love” doctrines made her increasingly controversial.\nAfter years of speeches before packed houses, the adulation of thousands, and acceptance in the wealthiest circles of the nation, Woodhull lost support because\nof her embroilment in scandal and manipulation, her scathing critiques and unveiling of hypocrisies. She and her sister moved to England in 1877, married wealthy men and lived comfortable, conventional lives.\n\n	2016-08-25 17:40:23.092455	\N	f	t	1	https://www.womenofthehall.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/victoria-woodhull-150x150.jpg	
768	Charlotte	Woodward				768	Charlotte Woodward inspires me because of the sixty-eight women who signed the Declaration of Sentiments at Seneca Falls in 1848, only one--Charlotte Woodward Pierce--lived to see the day that women won the right to vote. \n\nIn 1848, Charlotte Woodward was eighteen or nineteen years old, probably of Quaker background and living in Waterloo, New York. Although she had been a school teacher when she was fifteen years old, she worked at home in 1848, sewing gloves from pieces sent out by merchant-capitalists. Charlotte Woodward was not happy with her limited opportunities. "I do not believe there was any community anywhere in which the souls of some women were not beating their wings in rebellion. . . . Every fiber of my being rebelled, although silently, for all the hours that I sat and sewed gloves for a miserable pittance which, after it was earned, could never be mine. I wanted to work, but I wanted to choose my task and I wanted to collect my wages."\n\nWith such awareness, Charlotte Woodward was delighted when she read the announcement for the woman's rights convention. Historian Rheta Childe Dorr described Charlotte's reaction, based on an interview with her in 1920. She ran from one house to another in her neighborhood, and found other women reading it, some with amusement and incredulity, others with absorbed interest. Half a dozen of Charlotte's intimate friends were interested enough to agree with her that they must attend the convention, at least on the first day when only members of their own sex would be present. . . . Early on the morning of July 19 those country girls started on their long drive, in a democrat wagon drawn by fat farm horses. . . . As they drove along they perceived an unusual number of vehicles, family carriages, chaises, surreys, democrats and even farm wagons, turning in from lanes and byways to join the procession on the main high road. Women formed the majority of the passengers, but some of the vehicles were driven by men. When the girls arrived at the Wesleyan Chapel in Seneca Falls they found about fifty men waiting to be admitted to a meeting advertised for women only. Mrs. Pierce remembered that it was the presence of these uncommonly liberal men that gave her courage to stay over for the second day's session.\n\nCharlotte Woodward traveled farther than almost anyone else who came to the Seneca Falls convention. According to the index of the 1850 census, published by the Mormons, only one Charlotte Woodward lived in New York State in 1850. She lived in DeWitt, Onondaga County (near Syracuse, about 40 miles east of Seneca Falls) in the home of Moses and Hannah Chapman, aged 58 and 55. Moses was a farmer, born in Connecticut, who listed his assets at $15,000, quite a munificent sum in 1850. Other members of the household included Amos Fancher (22, farmer), Rachel Jones (13), John Doyle (15), Mary M. Carthe (perhaps meant to be McCarthy, age 80, born in Ireland), and Calton E. Chapman (79).\n\nCharlotte Woodward eventually married (Newlin? Pierce) and moved to Bristol [Rhode Island?] and later to Philadelphia, where she lived the rest of her life. She joined the American Woman Suffrage Association rather than the National Woman Suffrage Association, which Stanton and Anthony had organized, but, she wrote to Mott in 1871, "our aim is the same, what matter if we do not all choose the same means to accomplish it?" She also became active in the Association for the Advancement of Women. She knew Susan B. Anthony and called her "a great and noble woman."\n\nHer conciliatory attitude toward all branches of the suffrage movement lasted until her death. In 1921, when she was 92 years old, she sent a trowel to the National Woman's Party, to be used in laying a cornerstone for the NWP's headquarters in Washington, D.C. The inscription read, "In memory of the Seneca Falls Convention in 1848: presented by its sole survivor, Mrs. Charlotte L. Pierce, in thanksgiving for progress made by women and in honor of the National Woman's Party, which will carry on the struggle so bravely begun." When observers took this as an endorsement of a party for women only, Woodward Pierce quickly clarified her views. The National Woman's Party, she said, "seems to be a woman's party. I do not believe in that. I think women should go into the existing parties." "My heart is with all women who vote. They have gained it now, and they should not quarrel about the method of using it."\n\nSadly, Charlotte L. Woodward Pierce herself never voted. She was ill on election day, 1920, and by the spring of 1921, her eyesight failing rapidly, she was confined to her home. "I'm too old," she said. "I'm afraid I'll never vote." And, as far as we know, she never did.\n\nWritten by Judith Wellman	2016-08-25 17:40:23.148492	\N	f	t	1		
769	Martha Coffin Pelham 	Wright	1806	1875	https://www.womenofthehall.org/	769	Martha Coffin Pelham Wright’s life as an activist was influenced by her Nantucket Quaker heritage. With a strong female role model in her mother, Anna Folger Coffin, and the Quaker tenets of individualism, pacifism, equality of the sexes, and opposition to slavery, young Martha was well prepared for her future role as an abolitionist and suffragist.\nMartha Coffin was the youngest of eight children, born in Boston on Christmas Day, 1806. The Coffin family moved to Philadelphia when she was three. Following the death of her father in 1815, Martha’s mother opened a boarding house. Martha attended a Philadelphia day school and eventually transferred to a Quaker boarding school outside the city.\nIn 1822, Peter Pelham, a wounded soldier from the War of 1812, came to Philadelphia for medical care and boarded at the Coffin home. Martha, then 16, and Peter, 37, fell in love and wished to marry but Peter was not a Quaker and Martha’s mother refused to give consent. He left for a Florida military posting, but maintained correspondence during his time away. Upon his return to Philadelphia in 1824, Mrs. Coffin finally gave consent for the couple to marry. The Quaker community, however, refused to accept the marriage and Martha was expelled from the group for marrying outside the faith.\nFollowing Peter’s early death in 1826, 19-year old Martha and her year old child, Marianna, joined Martha’s mother in Aurora, New York. Here she taught with her mother at a Quaker girls” school and in 1829 married David Wright, a young law student. As David’s law practice grew, the family moved to nearby Auburn, the county seat.\nIn the summer of 1848, Wright, by then six months pregnant with her 7th child, joined her older sister, Lucretia Coffin Mott, at a meeting with Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Jane Hunt, and Mary Ann M’Clintock in Waterloo, NY. These five women planned and led the first women’s rights convention, held in Seneca Falls, NY on July 19th and 20th, 1848 – an event of worldwide historic importance.\nThus began Wright’s twenty plus years of dedication and commitment to women’s rights and the abolition of slavery. She traveled extensively on behalf of the American Anti-Slavery Society and the National Woman Suffrage Association, which she served as president in 1874. Minutes from the 1874 NWSA meeting in New York City read in part, “Martha C. Wright, one of the most judicious and clear-sighted women in the movement‚” a fitting tribute to one of the major 19th century reform leaders of New York State.\n\n	2016-08-25 17:40:23.168584	\N	f	t	1	https://www.womenofthehall.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/martha-coffin-pelham-wright-150x150.jpg

She lived according to her own ideals rather than society’s dictates.\nWright was an inspiration to Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton. She was a friend to the Marquis de Lafayette, and with him visited Jefferson and Madison. In 1852 she published a treatise setting forth a plan for the gradual emancipation of all American slaves, and in 1825 created Nashoba, a settlement in Tennessee to train slaves for freedom. For a variety of reasons the project failed, and Wright then moved to New Harmony, where Robert Owen had created his Utopian community. She helped edit the New Harmony Gazette and gave public lectures – considered scandalous in society of the time. She supported the free-thinkers, publishing the Free Enquirer with Robert Owen, calling for birth control, liberalized divorce laws and more. Courageous throughout her life, her tombstone in Cincinnati reads, “I have wedded the cause of human improvement, staked on it my fortune, my reputation and my life.”\n\n	2016-08-25 17:40:23.188113	\N	f	t	1	https://www.womenofthehall.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/fanny-wright-150x150.jpg	
767	Victoria Clafin	Woodhull	1838	1927	womensenews.org	767	The formidable sisters Victoria Woodhull and Tennie C. Claflin started as stock traders at Forty-four Broad Street, but march right into history with journalism and politics. Woodhull & Claflin's Weekly, begun in the early 1870s, exposed the adultery of the famed Brooklyn preacher, Henry Ward Beecher. Their frank accounts of the scandal sent Victoria Woodhull to jail on obscenity charges. The weekly closed briefly but reopened at this site, and continued until 1876. In 1872, Victoria Woodhull entered the campaign for president, running on a platform of individual rights. Shortly before she began her newspaper, she gave a speech in Apollo Hall that explicitly clarified her stance on women's rights:\n\n" have asked for equality nothing more. ... Sexual freedom means the abolition of prostitution both in and out of marriage, means the emancipation of woman from sexual slavery and her coming into ownership and control of her own body, means the end of her pecuniary dependence upon man ... means the abrogation of forced pregnancy, of... undesired children and the birth of love children only.\nRise and declare ... yourself free. Women are entirely unaware of their power. Like an elephant led by a string they are subordinated by ... just those who are most interested in holding them in slavery. If the very next Congress refuses women all the legitimate results of citizenship ... we shall proceed to call another convention expressly to frame a new constitution and to erect a new government ... We mean treason, we mean secession, and on a thousand times grander scale than was that of the South. We are plotting revolution." Source: Women's eNews\n\n**It would also be worth looking up Tennessee Claflin, Victoria’s younger sister who worked with Victoria on every venture she undertook, and adding her to this archive entry, too. They were inseparable until they moved to England and married men who took them to different parts of Europe. Tennessee married Sir Francis Cook.  For whatever reason, Tennessee gets far less credit for the radical campaigns, lectures, published pieces, etc, even though it was always the sisters together making it happen. \n	2016-08-25 17:40:23.128082	\N	f	f	1	http://a5.files.biography.com/image/upload/c_fit,cs_srgb,dpr_1.0,h_1200,q_80,w_1200/MTIwNjA4NjM0MDE1MTU1NzI0.jpg	
771	Chien-Shiung 	Wu	1912	1997	https://www.womenofthehall.org/	771	Dr. Chien-Shiung Wu, a pioneering physicist, radically altered modern physical theory and changed our accepted view of the structure of the universe.\nBorn and educated in China, Wu received her bachelor’s degree in physics from National Central University in 1934. In 1936, she moved to the United States, where she pursued a doctorate in physics from the University of California, Berkeley (1940). Dr. Wu taught briefly at Smith College before being hired as Princeton University’s first female instructor.\nA year later, Dr. Wu accepted a post at Columbia University, where she became involved in the Manhattan Project, designing and building the world’s first atomic bombs. She held various positions with the university until her retirement in 1981, but is best known for her experiments on beta decay in 1957. For six months, Dr. Wu tested the theory presented by Drs. Tsung-Dao Lee and Chen Ning Yang, that parity – a theory that the laws of nature are not biased in any particular direction – was not conserved in certain types of nuclear reactions. Dr. Wu’s groundbreaking experiments proved Drs. Lee and Yang’s theory right; the longstanding belief that parity was conserved in weak subatomic interactions was shattered, altering the way in which scientists viewed the structure of the universe. In late 1957, Drs. Lee and Yang were awarded the Nobel Prize in physics for their theoretical contributions to the project, while Dr. Wu’s experimental proof of the theory was overlooked.\nDr. Wu received numerous awards for her work, including eight honorary degrees, the National Medal of Science (1975), the first Wolf Prize in Physics awarded by the state of Israel (1978), the first Research Corporation Award given to a woman (1959), and the first Comstock Award given to a woman from the National Academy of Sciences (1964). She was elected as a member of the National Academy of Sciences in 1958, and in 1990, Dr. Wu became the first living scientist with an asteroid named after her.\nAs one of the world’s foremost nuclear physicists, Dr. Wu’s work was instrumental in shaping modern physical theory and blazing a trail for women in science.\n\n	2016-08-25 17:40:23.21193	\N	f	t	1	https://www.womenofthehall.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/chienshiung-wu-150x150.jpg	
774	Gloria	Yerkovich	1942		https://www.womenofthehall.org/	774	Gloria Yerkovich discovered the absence of a national system for locating missing/abducted children when her daughter was abducted by her natural father in 1974. Yerkovich didn’t see her daughter again until l984.\nYerkovich searched for years, and realized the heart of the problem of many abducted and missing children lay in the absence of a way for such children to find help. Yerkovich started CHILD FIND in 1981, and built the organization with volunteer labor, donated equipment and skillful appeals to the media for help and support. Since more than 150,000 children a year are considered missing or abducted, a national registry of missing children was developed, as was a photographic directory of such children, and implementation of a toll-free number for children trying to find their parents.\nCHILD FIND was the prototype for the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, and Yerkovich’s efforts contributed greatly to national awareness of the problem. Awareness led to the l982 Omnibus Victims Protection Act and the Missing Children Act, the signing of which Yerkovich witnessed at the invitation of the President of the United States.\n\n	2016-08-25 17:40:23.252404	\N	f	t	1	https://www.womenofthehall.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/gloria-yerkovich-150x150.jpg

779	Mildred "Babe" Didrikson  	Zaharias	1911	1956	https://www.womenofthehall.org/	779	Babe Didrikson the female athletic phenomenon of the century, was the child of Norwegian immigrants. Reared in poverty in South Texas, she began her extraordinarily versatile athletic career in high school basketball. She soon found that few sports opportunities were open to women. In fact, in the 1920s the trend was toward the elimination of interscholastic competition for girls, because of its “undue stress” and “morbid social influences.” In many high schools all but intramural sports disappeared, and not until the 1970s would girls’ high school competition be restored.\nAfter Babe switched to track and field and collected gold medals at the 1932 Olympics, her fame enabled her to barnstorm the country with a team called “Babe Didrikson’s All Americans.” She excelled at every sport she tried, but she combined her natural talent with hard work. When she first took up golf she hit over a thousand balls a day, eight to ten hours a day. Drives of two hundred and fifty yards were not unusual for her.\nShe began to win the major ladies’ golf tournaments but was quickly ruled a pro and disqualified. There was then no pro golf tour for women. Only after 1938, when she met and married George Zaharias, a professional wrestler, could she afford to refuse endorsements and reestablish amateur status. Babe went on to sweep the major ladies’ titles. In 1949 she became one of the founding members of the Ladies’ Professional Golf Association. A fierce competitor with a free-wheeling style, she closed her career with a courageous, losing battle against cancer.\n\n	2016-08-25 17:40:23.393634	\N	f	t	1	https://www.womenofthehall.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/mildred-babe-didrikson-zaharias-150x150.jpg

My grandmother, Jean,  (mother of the groom), remembered how deeply her Jewish family had been discriminated against during her childhood and she refused to let my parents and their friends be shunned in the same way, so she took what little savings she had as the widow of a police officer killed in the line of duty just a few years prior, and she paid for the wedding herself. She opened the reception to any and all invited. This was a bold, and even dangerous, thing for the only Jewish woman in a small Southern town to do in 1970. But she did it anyway, because she was a woman who spoke with her feet; she acted on what she believed was fair and just. Her activism was her life. She never carried a sign in protest, but she did take brave steps every day towards equality in the way she served her country and her community. She would be shocked that I would mention her life in this way, because to her it was nothing special to be a woman of her word and a woman of conviction. But it was this word and conviction, coupled with action, that made her one of the greatest American women I've ever known or heard of. She was actively rooting for a female president when she died in December of 2015. She deserved to see that dream come true, and I'm sad that she never did. But the women who've gone after her--though they do not know of her--owe a debt to great American women like my grandmother who took risks, and staked claims for the rest of us.	2016-08-25 19:26:36.164092	\N	f	t	1

The Heart co-produced a 4-part episode on the story of child sexual abuse that featured the story of Tennessee. As a survivor of childhood sexual abuse, Tennessee has learned to cope with it in different ways that she explains throughout the episode. Her ability to confront her trauma and express it in a way that will push other women to come forward about their experiences as well. She now has founded the The Silent Evidence project which is a continuation of her podcast on The Heart. It uses audio recordings and sound to facilitate understandings of the global sexual abuse problem. 	2016-08-25 19:26:35.153499	\N	f	t	1

791	Sacagawea		1788		https://www.womenofthehall.org/	791	Sacagawea (Sacajawea, Sakakawea), famed Native American woman whose land survival expertise and interpretive abilities were essential to the success of the Lewis and Clark Expedition, was born in a northern Shoshone village near the Lemhi River valley, in what is today Idaho. Between her tenth and twelfth year, she was taken to live among the Hidatsas of the Knife River area, modern day North Dakota.\nIn April 1805, Sacagawea, her husband Toussaint Charbonneau and their infant son, Jean Baptiste (Pomp), left Fort Mandan with the Lewis and Clark Expedition to explore the western lands recently acquired in the 828,000 square mile Louisiana Purchase. Considered at first to be simply Charbonneau’s wife who possessed specific native language interpretation abilities, Sacagawea became one of the most valuable members of the Corps.\nSacagawea helped supply the Corps with food foraged from the wild‚ roots, berries and other edibles. She was very calm and collected in crises and saved valuable records, instruments and other supplies when one of their boats almost capsized. Saving Clark’s journals preserved the history of the expedition for future generations.\nLewis and Clark knew in advance that they would need the skills of a Shoshone interpreter when they would have to negotiate for horses to take them through the mountains. In August of 1805, west of the Continental Divide, when the expedition needed to secure horses, Sacagawea was joyfully reunited with her brother, Cameahwait. He provided horses and guides to the Expedition, assisting their journey across the Bitterroot Mountains and through the Salmon River country to the Clearwater and Columbia Rivers. In November 1805, the Corps reached the shores of the Pacific and Sacagawea saw the “great waters.”\nThough her later life is shrouded in mystery and controversy, Sacagawea’s documented skill, determination, courage, and insight on the Expedition live on as an outstanding model and feat of great achievement.\n	2016-08-25 17:40:23.546678	\N	f	t	1	https://www.womenofthehall.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/sacagawea2-150x147.jpg

Petcoke is a toxic carbon byproduct from the oil refining process. It can cause short and long-term health problems for residents who breathe in the petcoke dust and no one was listening to these marginalized Southeast side residents who were suffering.

She has successfully forced local and state politicians to take action against unsafe petcoke storage in residential areas and has made her community's voice heard.

458	Sarah M.	Martin				458	Sarah M. Martin was born in South Carolina, and came to New York City when she was 12 years old. A resident of Grant Houses for 57 years, Sarah moved in just after getting married and recalls when the public housing complex had a strong sense of community. “People didn’t lock their doors and residents watched out for each other’s children.” Building on earlier organizations, in 1994 the Grant Houses Residents’ Association was formed to work on issues within the housing complex and in the broader community. Sarah was elected Vice President and then President, and joined forces with Joan Levine, from the housing complex across the street, to tackle trash and rat infestation and to help form the Morningside Heights/West Harlem Sanitation Coalition.\n\nTaking the motto Reduce, Reuse, Recycle to heart, Martin saw that efforts by NYC Housing Authority to introduce trash reduction and recycling were unsuccessful because they didn’t include residents in education and outreach efforts. Together Martin and Levine developed a hands-on educational approach that continues to be used by city agencies to educate volunteers and the public.\n\nMartin is on the steering committee of the Broadway Democratic Club and has been able to turn Grant Houses, with its 1,940 apartments and over 4,500 residents, into a powerful political force. She works on issues of air quality and its effects on asthmatics, noise reduction, public safety, and on increasing civic participation by her neighbors. Her efforts (including knocking on 1,940 doors) assured that Grant Houses became one of the most successful public housing recycling programs in the city.\n\nShe continues to be active with the Morningside Area Alliance, Mt. Sinai’s Center for Occupational & Environmental Medicine, the Partnership Committee of the Morningside Retirement and Health Services, NYCHA’s Manhattan North Council of Presidents’ Committee, and West Harlem Environmental Action.	2016-08-25 17:40:17.926831	\N	f	t	1		\N

379	Jenny	June	1829	1901	womensenews.org	379	New York World, 32 Park Row was the home of the New York World in its earliest days. Jane Cunningham Croly (1829-1901), who used the byline Jenny June, became women's department editor of The World in 1862, but there was almost no paper in town she did not write or work for. In 1868, signing only her initials, she nervily applied for a ticket to a dinner tendered by the Press Club of New York. She was found out and rejected; no women need apply. She responded by convening a number of female colleagues and planning to give women a club of their own, the first of its kind. They called it Sorosis--a flowering plant. Later, she fostered the creation of the Women's Press Club of New York. When asked why more women had not followed her into daily journalism, she said:\n\n"Sex alone, not at all capacity. There are plenty of women who would be preferred as workers to men, if they were not women. But men are not accustomed to act with women from a business point of view, and their presence oppresses them. They will stand carelessness, negligence, even drunkenness from a man, because that is in the regular order of things, but a woman, without trial, is generally understood to be a "nuisance" in a newspaper office. Then, it is true that they cannot as yet be put upon subordinate routine work. A large part of the work of a daily paper has to be done at night, and editors say, with truth, that a sense of impropriety attaches to the idea of a woman going unattended to night meetings for the purpose of reporting them, returning late to the office, writing her report and traveling home alone after midnight. Still, there are many things that a woman can do upon a daily journal, and women could be used upon them much more than they are, with benefit to the journals themselves." \n	2016-08-25 17:40:16.489656	\N	f	t	1	https://www.womenofthehall.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/jane-cunningham-croly-205x329.jpg

409	Jhumpa	Lahiri	1967			409	Nilanjana Sudheshna Lahiri – better known as “Jhumpa” was born in London, England to parents who had emigrated from India. This Pulitzer prize-winning author now makes her home in Fort Greene, ‪‎Brooklyn‬. Her work often sheds light on the challenges and beauty inherent in the lives of her Bengali parents and immigrants throughout the world.\nLahiri’s first book, Interpreter of Maladies, was published in 1999 and quickly earned acclaim; in addition to the Pulitzer, Lahiri was also honored with the PEN/Hemingway Award. Her subsequent novels have “dealt with themes of nationality, tradition, family, exile and belonging.” Lahiri described discovering her joy of reading as a child: “Reading was this secret gift. Even as a little girl, I was aware when I read that finally, OK, here was the mission, here was my life—literature. The whole meaning of my life started the moment I discovered a library. And yet that dizzying sense of purpose and freedom and possibility was something I couldn’t share with my parents.” Lahiri speaks of the inner-conflict created by differences in language and experience between herself and her parents – a conflict illustrated in all of her work.\nIn 2014, President Barack Obama awarded Lahiri with the National Humanities Medal, “which honors those who have widened the public’s engagement with literature and deepened the nation’s understanding of the human experience.” In a statement, the National Endowment for the Humanities, an independent national agency that awards grants for cultural research, said that Ms. Lahiri had “illuminated the Indian-American experience in beautifully wrought narratives of estrangement and belonging.”	2016-08-25 17:40:17.033267	\N	f	t	1	https://www.randomhouse.com/kvpa/jhumpalahiri/images/jhumpa_lahiri_photo_new.jpg

When Frank Leslie died in 1880, he left a bankrupt business to his wife. Miriam took charge of the magazine empire and borrowed $50,000 to pay the debts.  She took on the name Frank Leslie and reorganized the business.  .Her editorial policy was “The public shall have the newest news,” and used women extensively because she felt that women were “born disseminators of news.”  She was successful in bringing new life and financial health to the organization, and for the next fifteen years reigned as “The Empress of Journalism.” She is buried at Woodlawn Cemetery. 	2016-08-25 17:40:17.306304	\N	f	t	1	http://www.shippassengers.com/vips/images/Miriam-Florence-Folline-Leslie.jpg	
431	Audre	Lorde	1934	1992		431	Audre Lorde  was born in Harlem, NY to parents who had immigrated from the Caribbean. Poet and activist Audre Lorde broke new ground with her writing and used her art and voice to amplify the civil rights, women’s, and gay liberation movements.\nFrom an early age, Audre found respite in the works of poets – reading and reciting the poems of others before beginning to write her own at the age of 12. As an adult, this self-described “’black, lesbian, mother, warrior, poet’ dedicated both her life and her creative talent to confronting and addressing the injustices of racism, sexism, and homophobia.”\nIn 1968, her first volume of poems – The First Cities - was published. She would go on to earn many honors for her poetry, essays, and other writing, including the Walt Whitman Citation of Merit, which named her as “Poet of the State of New York” from 1991 to 1993. In designating her New York State’s Poet Laureate, Governor Mario Cuomo observed: “Her imagination is charged by a sharp sense of racial injustice and cruelty, of sexual prejudice … She cries out against it as the voice of indignant humanity. Audre Lorde is the voice of the eloquent outsider who speaks in a language that can reach and touch people everywhere.”\nHere is a small sampling of the writing she remains famous for:\n“I am not free while any woman is unfree, even when her shackles are very different from my own.” – Audre Lorde\n“Sometimes we are blessed with being able to choose the time, and the arena, and the manner of our revolution, but more usually we must do battle where we are standing.” – Audre Lorde	2016-08-25 17:40:17.51565	\N	f	t	1	https://flavorwire.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/audre-lorde-portrait.jpg

456	Philippa	Marrack	1945		https://www.womenofthehall.org/	456	Immunologist Dr. Philippa “Pippa” Marrack is one of the world’s leading research scientists investigating T-cells, the family of cells that help the body fight off disease. Her pioneering work isolating the T-cell receptor has led to a greater understanding of the molecular basis of the immune system, and has contributed to medicine’s current understanding of vaccines, HIV, and other immune disorders.\nDr. Marrack works in conjunction with her husband, Dr. John Kappler, studying the basic biology of lymphocytes and the application of the knowledge about lymphocytes to human disease. Much of their work concentrates on T-cells as they relate to protection against infection, their role in driving autoimmune and allergic diseases, and their possible role in rejection of cancers. In 1990, they discovered superantigens, extremely virulent toxins that cause an overwhelming and disastrous immune response, such as occurs in toxic shock syndrome. In a continuing drive to understand why some autoimmune diseases occur more frequently in women than men, she and Dr. Kappler have recently described a population of B cells that may account for some of this observation.\nRecognized as one of the most influential immunologists in the world, Dr. Marrack’s work in unraveling the immune system has led to numerous important discoveries that have impacted the health of millions. Dr. Marrack is an inductee in the Colorado Women’s Hall of Fame, a member of the National Academy of Sciences, the United States Institute of Medicine, and The Royal Society.

502	Mary Yuriko	Nakahara	1921	2014		502	Mary Yuriko Nakahara (known as Yuri Kochiyama) was bornto Japanese immigrant parents, Mary Yuriko Nakahara  did not see herself as an “activist” while growing up in her California hometown. She described her upbringing as fairly conventional until December 7, 1941. Following the bombing on Pearl Harbor by Japan, thousands of people of Japanese descent in the U.S. (including U.S. citizens) were detained as “suspects” by the Federal authorities. Among those arrested that day was Yuri’s father, who was recovering from surgery; he would die a few weeks later after being denied medical treatment. Later, Yuri, her remaining family, and 100000+ other Japanese-American people were held in internment camps for two to three years. Following her experiences, Yuri decided to devote her life to battling racial injustice – in whatever form.\n\nYuri and husband, Bill Kochiyama (a Japanese-American soldier in WWII), moved to New York City in 1946 and began raising their family. In 1960, the family of 8 moved to the Manhattanville Houses in West Harlem, where Yuri continued to become enmeshed in the civil rights movement. The family’s apartment in the was known as a haven for anyone involved in the struggle against inequality and Yuri became a familiar face on picket lines, in marches, and was famously seen cradling Malcolm X’s head in his final moments.\n\nIn the 1980s, Bill and Yuri Kochiyama were at the forefront of the fight for reparations for Japanese-American internees and celebrated the 1988 signing of the Civil Liberties Act – a formal government apology.\n\n	2016-08-25 17:40:18.642168	\N	f	t	1	https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f2/Yuri_Kochiyama.jpg	
522	Adelina	Otero-Warren	1881	1965		522	Nina Otero-Warren's Spanish conquistador ancestors dramatically altered the social and political landscape in Santa Fe more than three hundred years before she herself made waves as a twentieth-century suffragist, educator, and businesswoman. \nNina Maria Adeline Isabel Emilia Otero was born in Las Lunas, New Mexico, in 1881. Her conservative, prosperous parents traced their heritage to eleventh-century Spain. As Nina grew up, newly built railroads began bringing Anglos, commerce, and rapid change to her hometown. She attended Maryville College in Saint Louis from 1892 to 1894, then moved to Santa Fe when her uncle Miguel Otero was appointed territorial governor of New Mexico. There, she eventually married Lieutenant Rawson Warren in 1908. The marriage was short-lived, and Nina remained childless and independent for the rest of her years, though she helped raise her siblings after her mother's death. She focused on her professional life and politics, becoming one of New Mexico's most admired female leaders.\nBy 1914, Otero-Warren was drawn to the women's suffrage campaign in New Mexico when Alice Paul's Congressional Union (forerunner of the Woman's Party) sent talented organizers into the state. Otero-Warren soon rose to leadership ranks in the state Congressional Union (CU), rallying support among both Spanish- and English-speaking communities. Her family connections helped as well, as she was the niece of the popular head of New Mexico's Republican Party. Although New Mexico never legalized women's right to vote prior to ratification of the 19th Amendment, Otero-Warren's patient but incessant badgering of the New Mexico congressional delegation convinced them to vote in favor of the amendment in 1920.\nFrom 1917 to 1929, Otero-Warren served as one of New Mexico's first female government officials, as Santa Fe Superintendent of Instruction, and chair of the State Board of Health. By 1922, she won the Republican Party nomination to run for the U.S. House of Representatives. Although she lost her bid for Congress, a few years later she was appointed as state director of the federal Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) by President Franklin Delano Roosevelt.\nOtero-Warren's contributions to her community were not just in the political realm. She headed efforts to preserve historic structures in Santa Fe and Taos and built close ties with the artists, writers, and intellectuals who congregated in the area during the 1930s and 1940s. She was instrumental in renewing interest in and respect for Hispanic and Indian culture..."

However, at many points in her life, she found herself having to prove how successful she could be when given the chance. When speaking of transferring to a school where 98% of the students were White, Sklarek stated, “I was aware that the other students and the teachers considered me an inferior human being and I was going to SHOW THEM … which I did.” Sklarek known for her genial personality, as well as her bright mind, laughed as she recalls this early challenge. And it is easy to laugh at early doubters after a career with as many break-throughs for women, particularly African-American women, as Sklarek has had.\nSklarek was the first African-American woman licensed as an architect in the United States and is known for successfully leading major architectural projects such as Terminal One at Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) and the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo. In recognition of her achievements, Sklarek was appointed in 1990 to the American Institute of Architects’ College of Fellows, the 1st Black woman honored in this way. In keeping with her reputation for not only being quick-witted but a supporter of other woman, she responded to this honor by saying, “Fellowship is a sexist title … but I’ll take it!”\n	2016-08-25 17:40:20.980144	\N	f	t	1	http://www.visionaryproject.org/sklareknorma/sklarek.jpg

Wald believed in the idea of establishing a federal organization to help children and end child labor. Wald’s idea eventually became reality when the Children’s Bureau was founded in 1912. The Henry Street Settlement and the visiting nurse service are still functioning today in New York.	2016-08-25 17:40:22.324332	\N	f	t	1	https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/42/Lillian_Wald_young_in_nurse_uniform.jpg	
1086	Megan	Smith	1964	Today		1061	In 2009, President Barack Obama created the position of chief technology officer (CTO), whose brief is to apply technology to help the government achieve its goals more efficiently. Since then three people have served as CTO, with former Google vice president Megan Smith being the third. She was appointed in 2014 — the first woman, and the first lesbian, to hold the office. Growing up in northern New York State, Smith went to a progressive high school where, she says, “They just gave us a lot of space and we invented things.” The school also had a draft system for the math team, and the science fair was mandatory — exposing kids to what we now call STEM fields early on. Smith went to MIT and has been a star in the industry ever since, with stints at Apple, General Magic, and Planet Out before she joined Google in 2003. She’s worked on technologies ranging from smartphones to solar cars to bike locks. In an effort to educate more people on the Declaration of Sentiments, she is also on the hunt to find the original copy and share it with the world.	2016-08-30 18:09:43.172916	\N	f	t	1	https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/06/Megan_Smith.jpg/220px-Megan_Smith.jpg	\N

1097	Addie L.	Wyatt	1924	2012		1068	Rev. Addie L. Wyatt is one of the country's foremost labor union leaders, women's rights advocates and civil rights activist. She started working with the Amalgamated Meat Cutters and Butcher Workmen of North America in 1941 in Chicago and later became president of the local union -- the first female to hold such a position. She went on to become the first woman to be elected an International Vice President of Amalgamated. Wyatt's contributions not only helped that union to become more progressive, but also helped open the way for redefining women's roles within the general labor movement. Rev. Wyatt became an ordained minister in 1955. In 1956, she and her husband Rev. Claude S. Wyatt founded the Vernon Park Church of God in Chicago. From 1956 to 1968, she joined Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. in major civil rights marches. During this period, Wyatt also became director of the Women's Affairs and Human Rights departments in the Amalgamated Meat Cutters. Her successful leadership of that department led Eleanor Roosevelt to appoint her to serve on the Labor Legislation Committee of the Commission on the Status of Women in the early 1960s. In 1974, Rev. Wyatt was one of the founders of the Coalition of Labor Union Women (CLUW), the country's only national organization for union women. She is also a founding member of the National Organization of Women (NOW). In 1975, she was the first African-American woman named by Time magazine as Person of the Year. The publication recognized her for "speaking out effectively against sexual and racial discrimination in hiring, promotion and pay.	2016-08-30 20:16:19.675535	\N	f	t	1	https://wfphistory.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/addie-wyatt.jpg	\N
720	Lillian	Wald	1867	1940	http://jwa.org/womenofvalor/wald	720	Lillian D. Wald was a practical idealist who worked to create a more just society. Her goal was to ensure that women and children, immigrants and the poor, and members of all ethnic and religious groups would realize America's promise of "life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness."\n\nAs a young nurse, Wald hoped to provide decent health care to residents of New York's Lower East Side tenements. Her work as the founder of the Henry Street Settlement and the Visiting Nurse Service demonstrated her masterful administrative talents, deep regard for humanity and skill at fundraising and publicizing. Championing the causes of public health nursing, housing reform, suffrage, world peace, and the rights of women, children, immigrants and working people, Wald became an influential leader in city, state, and national politics. Her tireless efforts to link the health of children with the health of nations made her a model of achievement, caring, and integrity throughout her lifetime. Although Wald achieved international recognition, her efforts were always grounded in the belief that the world was simply an expanded version of the culturally diverse neighborhood.             	2016-08-25 17:40:22.337312	\N	f	f	1	https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/42/Lillian_Wald_young_in_nurse_uniform.jpg	
43	Dr. Evelina Lopez	Antonetty	1922	1984		43	Dr. Evelina Lopez Antonetty was born in Puerto Rico and moved to New York City at the age of 10 because of the financial hardships faced by her family during the Depression. Although these hardships were not immediately alleviated by the move to NYC, Antonetty would grow up to provide others with the kind of assistance she could have used when she first arrived. From an early age, Antonetty showed her awareness of the injustices experienced by others and a determination to help. Whether it was a family member, neighbor, or someone else in her community who needed assistance, Antonetty was known for stepping up as spokesperson, translator, services-navigator … whatever was needed. Antonetty went on to begin her professional career working for a union. Mentored there by community activists, Antonetty “developed into a formidable activist and community leader” in her own right. When Antonetty’s daughter started school in the Bronx, Antonetty joined the parents association. There, she was a champion for both big and small issues in her community – from the quality of the lunches to decentralization. “In 1965, frustrated by the lack of response on the part of the public school system to the needs of Puerto Ricans and other minorities, Antonetty joined forces with other parents to create United Bronx Parents (UBP), a grassroots organization dedicated to community development in the South Bronx area with special emphasis on educational reform.” Thanks to Antonetty’s leadership, the organization expanded beyond its original mission and was able to address other issues prevalent in the communities it served. Dr. Vicky Gholson, a former UBP board member, stated, “She was the spirit and the force behind bilingual education in the United States, to put it simply. It would not have happened in the quick form and fashion that it did if it were not for her energy and her organizing.” Today, the “mother of the Puerto Rican Community” has a street named after her in the South Bronx. \n	2016-08-25 17:40:10.829221	\N	f	t	1	\N	https://www.youtube.com/embed/t3I1RJccLVk
22	Manal	Al-Sharif	1979		https://www.facebook.com/manal.livefreeordie	22	Manal al-Sharif is a women's rights activist from Saudi Arabia who helped start a women's-right-to-drive campaign in 2011. Al-Sharif filmed herself driving a car as part of the campaign. The video was posted on YouTube and Facebook. Since, the Saudi Arabia law prohibits women from driving,  Al-Sharif was detained and released on May 21, 2011 and rearrested the following day. Nine days later, Al-Sharif was released on bail, on the conditions of returning for questioning if requested, not driving, and not talking to the media. The New York Times and Associated Press connected the women's driving campaign with the wider pattern of the Arab Spring and the long duration of al-Sharif's detention with Saudi authorities' fear of protests. Following her driving campaign, al-Sharif remained an active critic of the Saudi government, tweeting on issues including imprisoned female foreign workers, the lack of elections for the Shura Council, and the murder of Lama al-Ghamdi. Her work has been recognized by Foreign Policy, Time, and the Oslo Freedom Forum.	2016-08-25 17:40:10.478406	\N	f	t	1	\N	https://www.youtube.com/embed/xECB8Xyagnk

1110	Shamere	McKenzie		Today		1073	Shamere McKenzie was simply trying to find a way to pay her college tuition when she met her trafficker. He seemed like a nice guy, and he promised she could make money dancing. Instead he forced her into sex slavery. Escape unfortunately was never an option for her. It wasn't until the police busted the pimp (and her!) that she was able to find a way to liberate herself from his clutches. Even though Shamere was clearly a victim, she was charged alongside the pimp. Shamere is now a free woman. She is empowered by her recognition of her own strength, her faith, and her family and friends. She is now the Chief Executive Officer for the Sun Gate Foundation, an anti-trafficking organization that aims to provide educational opportunities for survivors of human trafficking. She is the former Program Assistant for Shared Hope International, an organization whose mission is to prevent, rescue and restore women and children in crisis. In addition, she is a subject matter expert consultant with Fox Valley Technical College Amber Alert TTA, a member of Who is Stolen performance troupe, a mentor to survivors of sex trafficking, a member of the National Survivor Network, the Survivor Leadership Institute and an international speaker on the issue of sex trafficking. She considers herself to be the voice for those still enslaved, those who perished while being enslaved, and those who were victims and are now free, and those who are still afraid to share their stories. Her strong determination and passion for success help her to keep her eyes on the prize. She believes that one day she will be a Human Trafficking Attorney, advocating for victims of modern day enslavement.	2016-08-31 20:20:30.990847	\N	f	t	1	http://www.luc.edu/media/lucedu/homepage/homepagescroll/Comm-shamere-headshot-web.jpg	\N
336	Abigail "Abby"	Hopper	1801	1893		336	Abby Hopper was an abolitionist, schoolteacher, and social welfare activist. She assisted in founding and led several nationally known societies for social reform during and following the Civil War. She was part of a small group of people who continued to work to end slavery nationwide after New York abolished slavery in 1827. She denounced New Yorkers who profitted from slave investment and trade and aided slaves who escaped North. Gibbons was prominent during and after the American Civil War, when her work in Philadelphia, Washington, DC and New York City included civil rights and education for blacks, prison reform for women, medical care for Union officers during the war, aid to veterans returning from the war, to help them find work; and welfare. Because she was a known abolitionist, her house was among those attacked and destroyed during the New York City draft riots of July 1863.	2016-08-25 17:40:15.831434	\N	f	t	1	http://gvshp.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/ahopper1.gif

1127	Zoe 	Root		Today	http://www.bronxdefenders.org/	1080	Tracey Jones didn’t have much of a childhood. Her home was abusive and unstable, she says. Fearing for her safety, Jones left. It was the early 1980s, in the Bronx.\r\n\r\n“And the streets got me,” she said.\r\n\r\nAt 16, she was trafficked by a pimp. She was arrested again and again, for prostitution and drugs. No judge ever asked why a teenager was working as a prostitute, she said.\r\n\r\n“I walked into the court, they threw me back in the streets,” Jones said. “I didn’t need to be thrown back in the streets. I needed help.”\r\n\r\nIn 2001, Jones got clean, and left sex work. But her past wouldn't stay behind her. When she applied for jobs, employers would ask about her record.\r\n\r\nTwo years ago, a call from the Bronx Defenders gave her a chance to put the past behind her for good. The group wanted to help her clear her criminal record, under a new state law for trafficking victims. New York State has no other expungement provisions.\r\n\r\nZoe Root leads the Prostitution Vacature Project at the Bronx Defenders. She decided to try a bold approach, seeking to get all 31 of Jones’s convictions erased, for drugs as well as prostitution.\r\n\r\nJudge Linda Poust Lopez, who presides over the Human Trafficking Intervention Court in the Bronx, approved the motion. Jones’s record was wiped clean.\r\n\r\nJudges have tremendous discretion, and another judge could have ruled another way. The decision to vacate all of Jones’s convictions is an example of how the approach, and personality, of an individual judge can matter profoundly to the outcome of a case.\r\n\r\nJudge Poust Lopez also gave a heartfelt speech, apologizing to Jones for the ways the state had failed to help her as a child. \r\n\r\nFor Jones, that apology meant everything. She asked if she could approach the bench, and give Judge Poust Lopez a hug.\r\n\r\n“I felt caring from her," Jones said. "I felt like she truly was apologetic for me being wronged all these years,” she said.\r\n\r\nThe hug opened the floodgates, Root said. Everyone in the courtroom was in tears, from the District Attorney to the court reporter, she said.\r\n\r\n“It was one of the more transformative and emotional experiences I have ever had in my life, inside or outside the courtroom,” Root said.\r\n\r\nUsually, court is either brutalizing or numbing, she said. “It felt like during Tracy's court appearance all of the humanity that has been sucked out of every other court appearance was suddenly flooding through the air vents.”\r\n\r\nJudge Sherry Klein Heitler oversees the city’s special courts, including the trafficking court that heard Jones's case. She has sat on the bench in New York City since 1994, and she knows court is not often a happy place.\r\n\r\n“We recognize that the last place somebody wants to be is in front of us,” she said. But every person in court still wants their story to be heard. “And I'm sure that person told that story to many different people, but they wanted to tell it to the black robe.”\r\n\r\nJones said telling her story isn’t easy. It takes her to dark places. But now, she won’t have to answer awkward questions when she applies for jobs, she said. “My past no longer defines me,” Jones said. “I feel free.” \r\n	2016-09-06 20:02:08.709469	\N	f	t	1	\N	\N
1128	Frances Ellen Watkins	Harper	1825	1911		1081	Frances Ellen Watkins was born September 24, 1825 to free black parents in the slave state of Maryland. Her mother died when she was two years old, and she was raised by an aunt and uncle.\r\n She attended her uncle’s school for free black children until the age of thirteen, when she was forced by circumstances to leave school and go to work.\r\n\r\nThe family for whom she worked ran a book store, which provided a rich source of reading material for the young woman and she was able to educate herself enough to obtain a position in Ohio, teaching domestic science, thus becoming the first black woman to teach in a vocational school. She soon tired of teaching, however, and joined a traveling circuit of lecturers, preaching on the evils of slavery and recounting the horrors slaves faced as they attempted to flee on the Underground Railroad. In 1854 she was hired by the Anti-Slavery Society of Maine as a full-time lecturer.\r\n\r\nMarried in 1860 to Fenton Harper, she had one daughter before being widowed in 1864. To support herself and her young daughter she returned to the lecture circuit but changed her message from railing against the evils of slavery to lecturing on temperance, and on the difficulties women faced in their battle for equal rights.\r\n\r\nAs a single mother struggling to support her daughter, Frances Ellen Watkins Harper’s life was not an easy one. Her travel schedule was exhausting; she sometimes gave three speeches a day to Sunday school audiences, women’s clubs, and Women’s Christian Temperance Movement conferences, exhorting women, both black and white, to seek both social and economic power, including suffrage. A founding member of the American Woman Suffrage Association, she gave the closing speech at the Association’s 1873 conference, noting that “as much as white women need the vote, colored women need it more,” thus attempting to clarify the unique problems faced by women of her race.\r\n\r\nDespite the paucity of her education, Harper was a prolific writer, producing many poems and short stories. Her only full-length novel, Iola Leroy: Or Shadows Uplifted, was published when she was sixty-seven years old and was reprinted in 1987. She continued to work for equality for women both black and white, until her death in 1911 at the age of 87.\r\n	2016-09-06 21:00:43.356414	\N	f	t	1	https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/33/Fewharper.jpg	\N

1133	Elaine	Harmon	1920	2015	www.lundberg.tv/cfpa	1085	The Chick Fighter Pilots were on a mission Wednesday at Arlington National Cemetery.\r\n\r\nThese are women who fly ­F-16s, who scramble to take down enemy planes, who pull nine G’s, who dogfight. And they’re fearless dropping the kids off at day care, too.\r\n\r\nThey gathered on a hot September morning to honor one of the pioneers who made everything they do possible: Elaine Harmon.\r\n\r\n“Please know how much she helped change the world,” Maj. Heather “Lucky” Penney told Harmon’s family.\r\n\r\nPenney, an F-16 pilot who scrambled over Washington on the morning of Sept. 11, 2001, on a potential suicide mission to take down Flight 93 before it could hit Washington, considers Harmon her spiritual grandmother.\r\n\r\nElaine Harmon, who died at 95, became a pioneer by joining the Women Airforce Service Pilots (WASP). But her family had to fight to get her buried at Arlington. (Associated Press) \r\n\r\n“Look at any female aviator,” she said, “and please know she is still alive.”\r\n\r\nHarmon defied the chauvinists and misogynists when she flew P-51 Mustangs during World War II as one of the Women Airforce Service Pilots (WASPs).\r\n\r\nThen, she showed Congress that women should be treated as proper veterans when she testified for the recognition of the WASPs and finally got what she was seeking in 1977.\r\n\r\nAnd, finally, after her death at 95 last year, she brought down one more barrier when an act of Congress made it legal for her and the approximately 100 surviving WASPs to be buried at Arlington with full military honors.\r\n\r\nHer ashes were inurned Wednesday morning after a 21-gun salute and a flyover of the planes she once piloted.\r\n\r\n“Doesn’t that bring back memories?” one of the female pilots said at the service as three P-51 Mustangs roared overhead.\r\n\r\nHarmon was one of a little more than 1,100 women who applied to serve as a WASP and earned her wings. The WASPs paid for their own room and board during training. They scrounged up clothing that looked like the men’s uniforms.\r\n\r\n  U.S. Air Force color guards with the urn carrying the remains of WWII WASP Elaine Harmon at Arlington National Cemetery. (Linda Davidson/The Washington Post) \r\n\r\nDuring their last graduation ceremony, in 1944, the commanding general of the U.S. Army Air Forces, who said he wasn’t even sure a girl could handle the controls of a plane, admitted: “Now, in 1944, it is on the record that women can fly as well as men.”\r\n\r\nThey ferried planes across the country and the oceans, they were test pilots, and they towed targets to give the artillery boys live shooting practice.\r\n\r\nWhen one of them died — this happened 38 times — Harmon said she remembered the WASPs passing around a hat to collect money to ship the body home. The government wouldn’t even pay for that.\r\n\r\nBut those fights seemed over in 1977, when they were finally recognized as veterans and received full benefits, said WASP Shirley C. Kruse, 94. But in 2015, then-Secretary of the Army John McHugh rescinded their eligibility for the cemetery, saying they don’t meet the requirements to be buried there.\r\n\r\n“I was just shocked,” said Kruse, who now lives in Pompano Beach, Fla. “It was appalling, if I can use that word.”\r\n\r\nAnother barrier for women in the military turned out to be a graveyard wall.\r\n\r\nThis infuriated Rep. Martha McSally (R-Ariz.), the nation’s first female pilot to fly in combat.\r\n\r\nHer support system during her flying days, when she was often the only female pilot anywhere, was a group of three WASPs she met at a luncheon. The times she told them she was fed up with the Air Force and wanted to quit, they yelled at her.\r\n\r\n“Why would you leave? They made us leave. Why would you choose to leave?” McSally said they told her. She owed those women, she said, including Harmon.\r\n\r\nThat Arlington burial ban happened right when the military was opening up most combat jobs to women.\r\n\r\nMcSally teamed up with Harmon’s family, who were writing letters and circulating a petition to get her final, handwritten wish fulfilled — to be laid to rest in Arlington.\r\n\r\nErin Miller, one of Harmon’s granddaughters, put her law firm work on hold and worked like mad to reverse the ban, all the while storing her grandmother’s ashes in her closet.\r\n\r\nLegislation was quickly written, McSally got bipartisan support, and the bill allowing all WASPs to be buried in Arlington with full honors was passed within 20 weeks — a miracle when it comes to Congress.\r\n\r\nAfter the fight, the ceremony on Wednesday was emotional and largely triumphant.\r\n\r\nThe family members — children, grandchildren, great-grandchildren — had great stories about their feisty and adventurous “Gammy,” who went bungee jumping at 80, dressed up for holidays and was a notoriously horrid cook.\r\n\r\nAnd the Chick Fighter Pilots (a real association) were there to tell them how much she meant to them, too.\r\n\r\nLt. Col. Caroline Jensen, an Air Force reservist with more than 200 combat hours who was the Thunderbirds’ first flying mom, said she is one of the Harmon Air Force granddaughters.\r\n\r\nAnd to honor her before the funeral, female pilots across the country took turns flying Harmon’s burial flag in their planes — from jet fighters to commercial airliners.\r\n\r\nAt the service, Jensen read the flag’s flight log. Among the trips: a flight across the D.C. skies in an F-16; several missions out of California to “undisclosed locations”; an F-16 combat maneuvering mission over Arizona, where the flag went supersonic and pulled “8.7 Gs, just for fun”; a trip above Texas in a T-38 Talon supersonic jet trainer; and a final flight in an F-15 Eagle.\r\n\r\nSome of the pilots thanked Harmon in the flight log. She showed women could not only fly, but could be considered equals in the air.\r\n	2016-09-08 19:32:30.161078	\N	f	t	1	http://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/459538/elaine-harmon.jpg	\N
1134	Alia 	Almirchaoui			www.globalfundforwomen.org	1086	Working In: Iraq\r\nOrganization: Organization of Women’s Freedom in Iraq\r\nDEFENDING: Freedom from violence for all women in Iraq\r\n\r\nThere is no one [person] that is better than another. I am here to defend diversity in society.”\r\n—Alia Almirchaoui\r\n\r\nWhen Alia was 13 years old, her parents died, leaving her in charge of her two brothers. With no way to provide for her family or pay rent, her neighbor pressured her into marrying him so that she and her brothers could continue to live in their home. Her husband soon became abusive. When Alia sought help from three other neighbors, her husband arranged for the neighbors to be “kidnapped,” then accused Alia of being responsible. She was sent to prison at the age of 14, where she was held for five years. There she met women from the Organization of Women’s Freedom in Iraq (OWFI), whose outreach inside the prison gave her comfort and hope.\r\n\r\nWhen Alia was released from prison, OWFI offered to house Alia in one of their safe houses. From the group, she also learned about her rights, and they encouraged her to become an activist and women human rights defender in her own right. “[OWFI] let me change my life and move forward from my situation. I did not know that I had the right to my dignity,” says Alia. “I learned from them that humanity exists and that I’m able to help other women. My life started to change after this.”\r\n\r\nAlia quickly became a strong defender of human rights for women and other marginalized groups in Iraq. With OWFI’s support, Alia opened and began to run a new safe house for women who have survived trafficking, abusive homes, or violence. Alia says she will turn no woman in need away. “I don’t exclude anyone. Women of color are always not welcomed [in other places]. They don’t welcome women who are in the sex industry. So they’re in my shelter.”\r\n\r\nAlia, who is a Black Iraqi, has also faced persecution due to her race. Black Iraqis—a minority of African descent—are regularly discriminated against or harassed in Iraq. “I defend Black Iraqis. Their rights are lost, so I decided that I will help anyone regardless of their skin color in Iraq,” says Alia. “There is no one [person] that is better than another. I am here to defend diversity in society.”\r\n\r\nDefending women’s human rights in Iraq is dangerous. The risks come from multiple sources, be it the government, extremists, or patriarchal and misogynist groups. Moreover, despite the dramatic increase in violence against women (including sexual violence) due to the armed conflict initiated by the Islamic State in 2014, it is illegal for NGOs in Iraq to run shelters. OWFI is currently advocating for a policy change that would allow women-run shelters to be recognized as legal by the state, which would provide women in danger with greater protection.\r\n\r\nAlia and other defenders face threats from militias, tribal groups, and government agencies that don’t support women’s rights. “The danger is always present because the women in the safe houses are in danger. Some of them are wanted by the police, and the tribes want to storm the places where the women are hiding,” says Alia. “I am in danger. In any moment, we don’t know what will happen.”\r\n\r\nDespite the danger and the struggle she’s facing, Alia is determined to continue her work helping other women. “I am proud to help women and women’s rights. I am proud about these issues and about my work. My house is always open for them.”\r\n	2016-09-08 20:03:33.397955	\N	f	t	1	https://www.globalfundforwomen.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/alia_thumbnail.png	\N
1136	Azra 	Causevic			www.globalfundforwomen.org	1088	Working In: Bosnia & Herzegovina\r\nOrganization: LGBTQIA Association Okvir\r\nDEFENDING: A dignified life, free from violence, for all LGBTQIA people\r\n\r\nWe must stand up for each other no matter what, in any kind of situation where we see injustice, exactly because we know what it’s like to survive those things."\r\n—Azra Causevic\r\n\r\nAs an activist, trans, and queer person, Azra has experienced discrimination, hate speech, and violence. Her identity as an activist is rooted in a deep sense of justice and responsibility. “I really believe that as someone who has survived and lived through injustice it’s my duty to react and to do right against the injustice,” says Azra. “I am fighting for the right to a dignified life, free of violence. A life where connections are made based on compassion, solidarity, and creativity. These are values that we need to reaffirm constantly when you live in an oppressive context with norms that divide people.”\r\n\r\nAzra co-founded LGBTQIA Association Okvir in Bosnia in 2011. The organization is the only women-led LGBTQ organization in the country; they create public awareness campaigns and events about gender and sexuality issues and build community through counseling, safety training, and a safe space to gather. In a country where LGBTQ people are often discriminated against, services like the ones Okvir offers are rare, and safe spaces where the community meets serve as a critical lifeline for those who are marginalized.\r\n\r\nBosnia is home to a community of strong and outspoken activists. Even so, fighting for the rights of the LGBTQ community is especially risky. The country is deeply rooted in traditional patriarchal culture, with a strong conservative Catholic, Orthodox, and Muslim political agendas that fiercely oppose LGBTQ rights. Prejudice is common, and LGBTQ people experience discrimination in many essential areas of public life, including at school and in health systems where people aren’t trained in working with the LGBTQ community to respect their rights or respond to their specific needs. Complicated territorial divisions mean that the minimal legal protections that do exist are applied inconsistently—for example, not all areas have laws against hate speech or hate crimes.\r\n\r\nThis means that for Azra and her fellow activists, public gatherings or demonstrations are nearly always met with threats. Police in Bosnia classify any public event hosted by an association like Okvir as “high-risk.” When a partner organization announced plans for the Sarajevo Queer festival, protestors uploaded videos to YouTube that included hate speech against gays and threats to behead the organizers. A public press conference Okvir and another organization hosted for “Coming Out Day” was interrupted by several men who protested and made threats against Azra and other organizers. Azra and activists like her are always aware of the possibility of violence.\r\n\r\n“Violence against LGBTQ people is on multiple levels, from not being able to walk down the street holding hands, to going to a doctor or gynecologist and – when you say you’re lesbian – finding that they would kick you out, to peer pressure and peer violence,” Azra explains. “If you don’t fit in gender norms, you are immediately a target.”\r\n\r\nBut even though threats to her safety are everywhere, Azra isn’t afraid. “Those experiences make us more aware,” she says. “Now we think more of security, more of safety, and how to use strategies and resources and to coordinate across the community. The good news about it is that you learn really a lot about yourself. I learned not to ignore the fear. I learned how to see it, recognize it, react sometimes instinctively in order to protect myself, and sometimes transform it, to make something out of it.”\r\n	2016-09-08 20:13:43.570411	\N	f	t	1	https://www.globalfundforwomen.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/azra-02.png	\N
1137	Bai Bibyaon Ligkayan	 Bigkay			www.globalfundforwomen.org	1089	Working In: Philippines\r\nOrganization: SABOKAHAN Lumad Women Regional Confederation, PASAKA Confederation of Lumad Organizations and BAI Indigenous Women Network \r\nDEFENDING: Ancestral lands in the Pantaron mountain range and demanding withdrawal of military and paramilitary groups\r\n\r\nThis is not only my struggle, but the struggle for my people and our struggle in defense of humanity.”\r\n—Bai Bibyaon\r\n\r\nPeace has been an elusive goal in Bai Bibyaon Bigkay’s lifetime, but she has never stopped working for it. For the Manobo leader, there can be no peace without the right to live and work in her ancestral lands in western Mindanao.\r\n\r\nBai Bibyaon was born during the Japanese occupation of the Philippines in World War II. She rose up to become the only woman chieftain of the Manobo Tribe.\r\n\r\nToday she is at the forefront of fighting off a new kind of occupation. It started in 1994 when a logging company came into the Pantaron Mountain Range– the ancestral lands of the Manobo. When the Alcantara & Sons timber company began cutting down trees, the tribe issued a warning. When the warning went unheeded, under the leadership of Bai Bibyaon and her colleague Datu Gibang, the people launched a tribal war against the logging company. The company backed out and the forest stood.\r\n\r\nBut mining companies soon replaced the loggers, backed up by soldiers and native Lumad men recruited into a paramilitary group called “Alamara.” “The paramilitary and the military sow terror in our communities,” Bai Bibyaon reports. “They are again displacing the Manobo to pave the way for the intrusion of another destructive project—mining.”\r\n\r\nThe Pantaron mountain range has caught the eye of major transnational investors due to its extensive mineral deposits. Mindanao is estimated to hold around half of the Philippines’ substantial gold reserves. But where the companies see profit, the Manobo people see the loss of the mountains that are their age-old source of food and livelihood.\r\n\r\n“Our ancestral lands are being taken away and in its place we are given, for example, one kilo of rice and some canned goods,” Bai Bibyaon says. Through deception and repression, land grabs are severely eroding the basis for the tribe’s physical and cultural survival. Bai Bibyaon now lives in an evacuation camp in Davao City. Her people were forced off their lands by the military occupation, in the name of counterinsurgency operations that actually serve to facilitate land grabs. If they return, many—especially outspoken leaders like Bai Bibyaon —will likely be killed by the army; if they remain in the camps and lose their lands they will die off with nothing to leave behind. There is only one option: to fight back.\r\n\r\nFrom the camp, Bai Bibyaon has continued to lead her people in protests and demand a safe return to their ancestral lands. A formidable figure, she has stood up to government officials and corporate representatives.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of displacement and disillusion with the government, the tribe still looks ahead. They have built their own schools to teach children to work the land and defend it. “I am inspired by the new generation – the young Lumads. I want them to have a better life than what I have experienced. I want the younger generation to harvest the fruit of our sacrifices.” Now in her seventies, Bai Bibyaon says the only hindrance she feels is the physical limitation of age. “But my fighting spirit is very high.”\r\n\r\nBai Bibyaon sees a universal thread uniting battles for defense of land throughout the world, especially when bound by an indigenous worldview. “The protection of the mountain, the protection of our ancestral domain, means the protection all of humanity,” affirms the tribal chief. “So this is not only my struggle, but the struggle for my people and our struggle in defense of humanity.”\r\n	2016-09-08 20:22:04.76563	\N	f	t	1	https://www.globalfundforwomen.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/bai_fb_800x800.png	\N

1135	Ana 	Sandoval			www.globalfundforwomen.org	1087	Working In: Guatemala\r\nOrganization: Peaceful Resistance “La Puya”\r\nDEFENDING: Community rights to land and resources and demanding the closure of the Progreso VII mine\r\n\r\nIn the end, all the struggles have the same objective: the defense of life. That is the most important, no matter where we are or what the specific goal of each fight is.”\r\n—Ana Sandoval\r\n\r\nAna Sandoval hadn’t yet finished high school when she began asking the questions that would lead her to co-found Communities in Peaceful Resistance “La Puya” to oppose a gold mining megaproject in her community. She soon became a leader of an unprecedented movement to defend land and resources, based on non-violent direct action and led by women.\r\n\r\nAs a student, Ana began to investigate the mining projects around La Choleña, her hometown in Guatemala. Despite the government’s denials, she discovered that mining concessions had been granted for vast areas in the San Jose del Golfo and San Pedro Ayampuc municipalities. Ana and other residents feared the environmental disaster and economic plunder they had seen in neighboring mining communities, so they decided to organize. They demanded that the Progreso VII Derivada mining megaproject, currently run by the US-based mining company Kappes, Cassiday & Associates (KCA), leave their community.\r\n\r\nIn March of 2012 community members blocked the entrance to the mine. One of the longest-running—and most successful—actions in Guatemala’s rich history of resistance to mining on indigenous and mestiza land had begun. For four years, women, men, and children have organized in shifts to prevent gold mining operations on their lands. Local activists put their lives on the line, with women lying down in the road to block the entry of mining machinery. They’ve been met with violent eviction by the police, smear campaigns, and constant harassment.\r\n\r\nAna, now 23, is a young woman with a strong commitment. “These projects are a time bomb for the communities,” she explains. “We’re trying to stop the destruction and pollution of the environment.” The La Puya Resistance won a huge battle in February 2016 when the country’s Constitutional Court upheld an earlier decision by the Supreme Court of Justice to suspend mining operations at Progreso VII. The goal now is to definitively rescind the operating license. “To definitively close the mine would be a great achievement for us and for Guatemala,” Ana affirms. “It’s part of saving mother nature.”\r\n\r\nEven with this victory, Ana realizes that she has a lifetime of struggle ahead. According to a complaint filed by La Puya, despite the permit suspension the company continues to secretly take out gold ore. Also, if the mine is closed, Ana is concerned the media will stop covering the story, and the movement will be more vulnerable without the international spotlight that she believes has saved them from worse repression in the past.\r\n\r\nPeople in the movement understand that their resistance at La Puya is one step down a long road. But that step has already changed lives. Ana is now attending law school. “As a lawyer, I can help the movement, and not only in the case of La Puya. Because this is not a fight that is going to end any time soon. There are more than 20 mining projects planned for the region.”\r\n	2016-09-08 20:08:49.879194	\N	f	t	1	https://www.globalfundforwomen.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/ana_thumbnail.png	\N
1109	Maria	Lee	1986	Today	https://mcruzlee.nyc/	1072	Maria Cruz Lee is a leader when it comes to fighting for the rights of both documented and undocumented immigrants across the country. \r\n\r\nBorn in the Philippines, she aims to continually connect, support and celebrate immigrants in all her efforts. She has truly inspired me to take a harder look at the issues impacting our immigrant populations and I admire her for taking on so many tasks at such a young age to advance the mission of helping immigrants, both from the Philippines and abroad. \r\n\r\nShe is a Board Member of the Queens-based non-profit, Pilipino American Unity for Progress (UniPro) which seeks to transform Pilipino students & young professionals into community leaders through its various programs that incorporate professional development, history and policy through the lens of the Pilipino experience. Maria is also a Board Member of the newly formed Filipino American Democratic Club of NY, the first-ever political club that organizes and leads the Filipino American electorate in New York City and New York State. \r\n\r\nBut Maria's efforts go beyond just the Filipino community. She served as Special Assistant to former Commissioner Fatima Shama at the New York City Mayor’s Office of Immigrant Affairs (MOIA) during the Bloomberg administration. She had joined MOIA as its first social media intern in 2010, created and implemented the agency’s social media strategy on multiple campaigns. This is where I met her. We were competing against one another for a social media award and she won. I examined her campaigns and was truly impressed by her work. Soon after, we began collaborating on initiatives to benefit immigrant communities in New York City.  \r\n\r\nI was sad when she left the City, but saw her work spread nationally. Maria was responsible for directing the implementation of Define American’s engagement initiatives and development of new programs. Every few weeks, it seemed like she was traveling the country to spread the mission of Define American. And although she no longer works there, she continues her work to bring the stories of our immigrant populations to the forefront.  \r\n\r\nMaria's work and tireless efforts to bring awareness to the problems faced by our immigrant population are an inspiration today when so many people are looking to target undocumented immigrants and keep them out of our country. In a country built by immigrants, Maria Cruz Lee gives me faith that we can all unite together and eliminate the barriers or "walls" that limit our understanding of all immigrants.  \r\n\r\nShe deserves to be honored and respected for her work in such a short amount of time.  I look forward to seeing what more she will accomplish in the years ahead.  \r\n\r\n	2016-08-31 20:19:59.844721	\N	f	t	1	https://s3.amazonaws.com/everipedia-storage/ProfilePics/6666600438926610262.PNG	\N
1124	Judith 	Lasch	1939	2004		\N	Judith Lasch was a television pioneer. At the dawn of cable TV in the 1980's, Judith recognized  that this new media could serve as a vibrant educational tool and also provide access for underserved voices.  While others raced to be part of "MTV" and other pop movements, Judith began producing "Focus On New York," a weekly show dedicated to giving community members, leaders, and businesses access to TV messaging that had previously only been available to corporate media buyers.  Over the next few years, Judith partnered with her three daughters to create Lasch Media and produce programming involving more global concepts, such as their roundtable series "World Affairs - Women's Perspectives" - a ground-breaking concept at the time. When Lasch Media worked to acquire sponsorship for the programming, it was told that "no audience would respect" or "want to hear news from women commentators."  Judith Lasch, accompanied by her production company powered by women, was a visionary leader at the forefront of public access to televised media.  Judith Lasch, widowed at 23 while pregnant with twins and a 2-yr old toddler, never forgot the value of education as a tool for those without access - and the value of the media as a tool for delivering educational access.  This is an issue and an approach that remains as vital today.	2016-09-04 18:38:31.388987	\N	f	t	1	http://ak-cache.legacy.com/legacy/images/Cobrands/Batesville/photos/Judith-Magee-Lasch-dead-98fd33b8-6d7c-4d2e-8bdf-fca0cb327f80.jpgx?w=80&h=80&option=0&v=0x0000000028e33bc8	\N

965	Audre	Lorde	1934	1992		960	I am proud to share my story of Audre Lorde, the great poet, writer and activist. Audre was one of the first people I met after moving to New York City in 1977. I was 22 years old, just out of college, with $35 dollars in my pocket and a handful of contacts. Audre helped me find work, she helped me find my people, and she helped me find the warrior poet who resided inside of me. Audre said it beautifully in her 1977 remarks to the Modern Language Association’s “Lesbian and Literature Panel”:\r\n \r\n“Perhaps for some of you here today, I am the face of one of your fears. Because I am a woman, because I am Black, because I am lesbian, because I am myself — a Black woman warrior poet doing my work — come to ask you, are you doing yours?”	2016-08-26 16:52:48.461569	\N	f	f	1	https://kinnareads.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/audre-lorde.jpg?w=1200	\N

605	 Linda	Sarsour				605	Proud Brooklynite Linda Sarsour began a life dedicated to civic activism after the September 11th tragedy.\nBorn and raised in Sunset Park by her Palestinian immigrant parents, Sarsour has stayed true to her ‪#‎Brooklyn‬ roots. She now lives and works in Bay Ridge, serving as the Executive Director of the Arab American Association of New York, a social service agency serving the Arab community in NYC.\nIn 2001, leaders in her community reached out to her to help other Muslims and Arabs who were being targeted by violence or having their civil liberties violated. Sarsour stated that she was able to use certain freedoms and advantages she possessed to help others: “Obviously I’m a fluent English speaker. I was born and raised here. I can relate to people in a way that some other people in our community can’t, and I saw the power that people in our generation can have to make change, practice freedom of speech. Because we’re American, we were born here, we’re not afraid to be deported. We have a lot of privileges that unfortunately a lot of people in our communities don’t have. I felt like this was a way to use my privilege.”\nFrom her initial work as a frontline organizer immediately following 9/11 to her current work for national and local organizations geared to helping the Arab- American community, Sarsour continues to stand up for the rights of others. In her current roles, Sarsour works with law enforcement and policymakers to develop balanced procedures and legislation in New York City and across the United States.	2016-08-25 17:40:20.344229	\N	f	t	1	https://static1.squarespace.com/static/52f14561e4b0f644f165ac6d/t/538f2b32e4b0ab327a065096/1401891634769/linda.jpg?format=750w

155	Carrie Chapman 	Catt	1859	1947	https://www.womenofthehall.org/	155	Growing up on the Iowa frontier, young Carrie Lane was active and self-reliant. She worked to put herself through Iowa State College, and become a principal and school superintendent, which were unusual posts for a woman.\nWhen she married Leo Chapman, she joined him to co-edit a newspaper, but their marriage was cut short by his sudden death. As a young widow, she took to the lecture platform and began to work for woman suffrage, first in Iowa and then nationally. Her second husband, George Catt, agreed she should devote two months each spring and fall to suffrage.\nShe became a dynamic speaker, and exhibited a great talent for organization. Under her leadership, the days of isolated efforts and lost causes would end. More than any other woman except Susan B. Anthony, Carrie Chapman Catt was responsible for securing women’s right to vote. In 1915, on the heels of a remarkable effort in New York State, Catt became the head of the National American Woman Suffrage Association and put into effect a secret “winning plan”.\nShe led a push for an amendment to the federal constitution and at the same time continued campaigns in the states to increase the pressure and the numbers of suffrage states. A series of state victories followed in 1917 and 1918. They were only the prelude to a tough national ratification battle until Tennessee finally put the Nineteenth Amendment “over the top” in August 1920. Carrie Chapman Catt also did international work for woman suffrage, repeatedly touring Europe and presiding in international suffrage groups.\n\n	2016-08-25 17:40:12.75627	\N	f	f	1	https://www.womenofthehall.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/carrie-chapman-catt-205x257.jpg

Despite the hardships, Berkman ascended to the position of Captain by the time of her retirement in 2006. 	2016-08-25 17:40:11.498122	\N	f	f	1

During the early twentieth century, this outstanding nurse and social activist was a dynamic force for social reform, creating widely-adopted models of public health and social service programs.\nWald’s nursing education in New York showed her that tenement residents lacked health care, and so she organized the Henry Street Nurses Settlement (l893), the first public health nursing program in the nation. Wald went on to help organize other public health nursing programs in universities and for organizations, including the American Red Cross. She was the first president of the National Organization of Public Health Nurses, a professional group she helped to create. Recognizing that the urban poor had great needs beyond health care, Wald expanded Henry Street services to include social services, especially those benefitting children. She led the charge to abolish child labor, and helped secure the creation of the federal Children’s Bureau in 1912.\n\n	2016-08-25 17:40:22.356991	\N	f	f	1	https://www.womenofthehall.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/lillian-wald-150x150.jpg

489	Lady Deborah	Moody	1586	1659		489	Deborah, Lady Moody (born Deborah Dunch) was the only woman to start a village in colonial America; she was the first female landowner in the New World.  She had an unusual influence in a society dominated by men, and was described by contemporaries as "a dangerous woman."  Born in London, Lady Moody left England in 1639 due to religious persecution having adopted Anabaptist beliefs. She settled first in Saugus, Massachusetts, but left there in 1643 after being admonished by the Puritan leaders for failing to conform to their religious beliefs. Many others with the same religious beliefs left with her. She led her group of religious dissenters fleeing persecution to found the town of Gravesend in 1643 in the Dutch colony of New Netherland. The people from Gravesend were granted religious freedom, which was unusual for that period, and the Quaker faith took root among them. Deborah Moody became influential in New Netherland and had good relations with governor Peter Stuyvesant. She died at Gravesend in 1659 and is believed to be buried in Old Gravesend Cemetery. Today, the area is part of Brooklyn in New York City with the original town square still evident in the street layout.	2016-08-25 17:40:18.455033	\N	f	f	1	https://scontent-lga3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/q85/p480x480/535072_653513528120030_1975381515482183946_n.jpg?oh=62ee71b7678833840e28d17868bf59ed&oe=5848BFA0

580	Anna Eleanor	Roosevelt	1884	1962		580	Born in 1884, native New Yorker Anna Eleanor Roosevelt came from a wealthy and well-regarded family. However, these advantages did not protect her from certain hardships, particularly the deaths of both parents and a younger brother when she was very young. Ultimately, Eleanor (often described as “shy” and “awkward” as a child) would go on to accomplish many remarkable firsts. After her husband Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s bout with polio cost him the use of his legs, Eleanor frequently made public appearances on his behalf – first when he was Governor of New York and later as President of the United States.\nAlthough a “controversial First Lady for her outspokenness, particularly her stance on racial issues,” ultimately Eleanor’s determination to stand up for the human rights of all earned her world-wide renown. Her many accolades include: the 1st Chair of the Presidential Commission on the Status of Women, 1st Chair of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, and 1st U.S. Rep to UN Commission on Human Rights.\nThe photo above, taken in December of 1949, shows Eleanor seated in the center of the dais at an event honoring service to the United Nations.	2016-08-25 17:40:19.867948	\N	f	f	1	https://scontent-lga3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s480x480/13529196_698735323597850_4661014661590546122_n.jpg?oh=d1b64336c3d3d024cf917e0d2621352d&oe=585B6F3F	
581	Ernestine	Rose	1810	1892	womensenews.org	581	The vanished Broadway Tabernacle, which stood at Broadway at Worth Street., was built in 1836 and was the city’s main meeting hall for suffragists, abolitionists, and prohibitionists until 1857. A major voice was Ernestine Rose, a foremother of the women’s rights movement. At the New York State Women’s Rights Convention in 1853, she spoke there on married women’s property rights:\n\n"The law allows the widow . . .  one cow, all sheep in the number of ten, with the fleece and the cloth from the same, two swine, and the pork therefrom. (Great laughter.) My friends, do not say that I stand here to make these laws ridiculous. No; if you laugh, it is at their own inherent ludicrousness; for I state them simply and truly as they are; for they are so ridiculous in themselves, that it is impossible to make them more so . . . In allusion to the laws respecting wills, I wish to say that according to the Revised Statues of our State, a married woman has not a right to make a will. The law says that wills may be made by all persons, except idiots, persons of unsound mind, married women, and infants. Male infants ought to consider it quite an insult to be placed in the same category with married women. No, a married woman has no right to bequeath a dollar of the property, no matter how much she may have brought into the marriage, or accumulated in it. Not a dollar to a friend, a relative, or even to her own child, to keep him from starving. And this is the law in the nineteenth century, in the enlightened United States, under a Republic that declares all men to be free and equal." \n	2016-08-25 17:40:19.883188	\N	f	f	1	https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/19/ErnestineRose.jpg

52	Alice	Austen	1866	1952	http://aliceausten.org/	52	Alice Austen was one of America's earliest and most prolific female photographers. Over the course of her life, she captured about 8,000 images. She also was a landscape designer, a master tennis player, and the first woman on Staten Island to own a car. Alice was introduced to photography when her uncle, Oswald Müller, brought home a camera when she was ten years old. Although she was very young, Alice was patient, intelligent, and strong enough to hold the big camera steady on its tripod; her hands were naturally skillful at adjusting the simple mechanism. When it was time for uncle Oswald to sail away again, he gave Alice permission to use the camera in his absence. Alice's uncle Peter, by now a newly-appointed young professor of chemistry, realized that in her hands the camera would become something more than a toy. On his frequent visits home from Rutgers University, he showed his enthusiastic niece how to use chemicals to develop the glass plates she exposed, and how to make prints from them. He and uncle Oswald helped Alice even further by installing, in an upstairs storage closet, a tiny home-built darkroom where Alice would spend hours on end developing plates, and toning and fixing her prints. By the time she was eighteen years old (the earliest year from which any of her photographic plates or prints survive), Alice Austen was an experienced photographer with professional standards. Alice made many early self-portraits, perhaps representing the natural vanity of an attractive, smartly dressed young woman. Alice Austen was active, social and well-traveled. Everywhere she went, she took her photographic equipment with her. In a horse-drawn buggy in the 1880's and 1890's, she carried her equipment around the unpaved roads of Staten Island...to Midland Beach, South Beach, to winter skating parties on the Island's frozen ponds and creeks and private parties at the homes of friends. Alice enjoyed many of the new sports of the time. Tennis was the sport she enjoyed the most and her camera was as much a companion as her racquet. In 1885 the first tennis club in the nation was established in Livingston. It was there that nineteen-year old Alice spent countless summer afternoons, on the courts and behind her camera, photographing the players and the crowds of spectators. Another sport fast becoming a national fad was bicycling, and Alice shared the enthusiasm of her good friend Violet Ward who wrote a book, Bicycling for Ladies, which was published in 1896. During the 1890's Alice began to travel outside the environs of Staten Island taking pictures. In the autumn of 1892, Alice and her mother made a trip to Europe. She continued to spend her summers traveling around Europe through the 1890's and into the early part of the 20th century, always accompanied by her cumbersome camera equipment. Alice also carried her camera equipment about the streets of New York, photographing the newly arriving immigrants and older residents as they went about their business. Alice always photographed the people and places of her world as they actually appeared, giving us a beautiful visual window on 19th century America. As she neared the age of fifty Alice Austen increasingly found herself playing the role of a prominent member of Staten Island society. Beginning in l9l0, Miss E. Alice Austen was listed annually in New York's Social Register. She frequented the Richmond County Country Club on S.I. and was a member of the Colony Club in Manhattan. Next to photography, Alice's second love was gardening and she worked almost every day from spring through autumn to improve the garden her grandfather, turning the ground of "Clear Comfort" into a horticultural showplace. In 1914, Alice founded the Staten Island Garden Club, an organization that celebrated its centennial in 2014 and its members still help maintain the beautiful Victorian gardens at the Alice Austen House Museum. When the stock market crashed in 1929 Alice, at sixty-three years of age, lost everything. From then on life was a desperate struggle to survive. Alice and Gertude opened a Tea Room on the lawn for a few years but it never yielded enough profit to support the household. As it became harder and harder to meet the expenses of daily living Alice began to sell the silver, art works and furniture that filled "Clear Comfort". She also mortgaged and re-mortgaged the house but finally lost it in 1945. In a final desperate act, Alice sold the remaining contents of her home for $600.00 to a dealer from New Jersey. However, before he arrived, Alice called Loring McMillen, a friend from the Staten Island Historical Society, and asked him to take her glassplate negatives for safekeeping. Alice and Gertude moved to a small apartment at first, but soon they could not afford the rent. Gertrude's family offered to provide housing, but only for Gertrude. Thus, on June 24, 1950 Alice took an oath declaring herself a pauper and was admitted to the local poor house, the Staten Island Farm Colony. Unbeknownst to Alice, a small publishing company called Picture Press was planning to do a book on the history of American women. One of the two partners, Oliver Jensen, sent out a routine letter of inquiry to various institutions concerning suitable photographs. C. Copes Brinley of the S.I. historical society responded by inviting him to look at those dusty boxes containing 3,500 of Alice Austen's glass plate negatives. So, on a cold dark night in October 1950, Constance Foulk Robert, a young researcher, met with Brinley and McMillen to go through the negatives. Realizing that she had stumbled on the work of a great woman photographer, she brought Oliver Jensen with her on a return trip. Signing an agreement with the Historical Society, Oliver Jensen then published many of Alice's photos in the Revolt of Women. He also placed an eight-page story (with later sequels) in Life, and six pages of Alice's travel photos in Holiday, raising more than $4,000. Miss Austen's third of the proceeds was enough to move her out of the Farm Colony and into a private nursing home. On October 9, 1951 Alice Austen was driven to see an exhibition of her pictures and to meet the three hundred guests who had been invited to celebrate Alice Austen Day. She is quoted as having said, "I am happy that what was once so much pleasure for me turns out now to be a pleasure for other people." Alice lived the next eight months in the nursing home, where she died peacefully in her sleep on June 9, 1952. A simple funeral service was conducted beside the Austen family plot in the Moravian Cemetery. Alice and Gertrude wished to be buried together, but their families denied the wish.

This did not deter her and in 1921, she created the “American Birth Control League, now “The Planned Parenthood Federation of America.” Sanger believed that women should have more choices in their lives and should have the right to determine when to bear children. Sanger also wanted to prevent illegal and unsafe or “back alley abortions.” Sanger’s efforts eventually paid off and birth control became legal in 1965. ‪	2016-08-25 17:40:20.309114	\N	f	f	1	https://scontent-lga3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xta1/v/t1.0-9/12439125_548524532021520_8789934391648684187_n.jpg?oh=7b3c44ea5cc69e390f0342e3745db304&oe=578020BF	http://bit.ly/1C24DPK

668	Lucy	Stone	1818	1893	https://www.womenofthehall.org/	668	As an orator and an editor, Lucy Stone won innumerable converts to the cause of women’s rights. Growing up on the family farm, she learned the difficulties women faced. Her mother’s hardships distressed her, and her father ridiculed Lucy’s desire to attend college.\nAt the age of twenty-five she entered Oberlin, a pioneering co-educational college. She supported her studies through teaching and housework until her father at last relented and gave her some assistance. Her study of Greek and Hebrew convinced her that crucial passages in the Bible (those declaring woman inferior) had been translated wrongly. When she graduated from Oberlin in 1847, Lucy Stone became the first Massachusetts women to earn a college degree.\nShe was a gifted public speaker, and a dedicated abolitionist. Soon she was appointed a lecturer for the American Anti-Slavery Society. Her natural eloquence drew large crowds, though she often had to face hostility. In 1850 she helped organize a women’s rights convention in Worcester, Massachusetts. There, at the first “national” convention, Lucy Stone delivered a speech on women’s rights that converted Susan B. Anthony to the cause. When she married Henry Blackwell (brother of Elizabeth Blackwell) Lucy Stone kept her own name, thus coining the phrase “Lucy Stoner” to describe a married woman who retains her maiden name. Lucy Stone took the lead in organizing the American Woman Suffrage Association. This group, considered the most moderate wing of the women suffrage movement, conflicted with Stanton and Anthony over policy and tactics.\nLucy Stone and her husband founded and edited the organization’s weekly newspaper, The Woman’s Journal, which was considered “the voice of the woman’s movement.” Lucy Stone spent her lifetime battling for women’s rights and inspiring others to join her cause.\n\n	2016-08-25 17:40:21.438457	\N	f	f	1	https://www.womenofthehall.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/lucy-stone-150x150.jpg

In 1899 she became one of the founding members of the Phyllis Wheatley Club of Colored Women, Buffalo’s first affiliate of the National Association of Colored Women (NACW). Six years later in 1905, Mary B. Talbert secretly hosted black political activists including W.E.B Du Bois, John Hope and nearly thirty others around her dining room table for the first meeting of what would eventually become the Niagara Movement, a forerunner to the National Association of Advancement for Colored People (NAACP).  Talbert became one of the first women to join the NAACP after its founding in 1909.  In 1916, Talbert was elected President of the National Association of Colored Women (NACW) and the Vice President of the NAACP.  \n\nAfter the war Talbert went to Europe to lecture on the importance of women’s rights and race relations.  She also became a dedicated advocate of the Dyer Anti–Lynching Bill introduced in 1919 by Missouri Congressman Leonidas Dyer.  In 1921 she became chair of the NAACP's Anti–Lynching Committee.

Irene Vasquez, chair of Chicano and Chicana studies at the University of New Mexico, wrote about how much education access meant to Otero-Warren: “For her, improving and extending education offered a means for empowering the community, particularly women.” 	2016-08-25 17:40:22.556599	\N	f	f	1	http://testkitchen.huffingtonpost.com/badass-women/adelina-nina-otero-warren/	
523	Adelina	Otero-Warren	1881	1965	http://newmexicohistory.org/people/nina-otero	523	Her notoriety as a suffragist and the respect she gained from her run for U.S. Congress led to her twelve-year tenure as Superintendent of Public Schools in Santa Fe County.  She took this next period of her professional life very seriously and worked hard to improve the schools by recruiting better teachers, closely monitoring school maintenance, and increasing teacher salaries.  However, her most significant contribution during this era involved her negotiation of the American impact on what she identified as the Spanish culture.  She realized that pressure from the federal government required the schools to Americanize—to assimilate to American culture and values—yet she also realized that local Spanish culture offered a deep history and rich culture in the region.  During her time as superintendent, she set about trying to strike a balance between curricular requirements on the one hand and Spanish cultural values on the other.  She gained a great deal of respect from parents, teachers, and pupils for her efforts on this front.\n\nAlways an educator, Nina wanted to offer the public a permanent record of the Spanish culture in New Mexico that she saw vanishing all too quickly.  Encouraged by her acquaintance Mary Hunter Austin, she wrote a book titled Old Spain in Our Southwest in 1936 as a sourcebook for young adults, and she also offered a critique of assimilation within its pages.  Her criticism of imperialism is of course not without its ironies, given the history of Spanish colonization of American Indian lands.  However, her writings still offer a window on the ways that Mexican Americans attempted to balance the influence of American culture with the traditions that prevailed in New Mexico during the Spanish and Mexican periods.

755	Frances	Willard	1839	1898	https://franceswillardhouse.org/	755	Frances Willard "a long-time resident of Evanston, Illinois, was one of the most prominent social reformers of the 19th century and arguably one of the generating influences in America’s long history of social justice and activism. Although best known as the president of the Woman’s Christian Temperance Union (WCTU), she was a leading activist in many important 19th century reform movements including woman suffrage, women’s economic and religious rights, prison reforms, education reforms, and labor reforms, such as child labor laws and the eight hour workday. Many things that we commonly take for granted, like age of consent laws, women’s marriage, property and citizenship rights, and alcohol and drug education among many others, had their origins in these movements.\nShe used the WCTU as an organizing force, advocating for broad social as well as political change, calling this wide program of reform her “Do Everything” policy, reflecting her advocacy not just of temperance but of women’s rights, social justice, and world peace. Willard also recognized the need not to simply advocate for women’s empowerment, but to provide women with the skills they would need in this new society. Under her leadership, the WCTU grew to be the largest organization of women in 19th century America. In her time all school children in the U.S. knew who she was. She was the first woman to be honored with her likeness in the US Congress Statuary Hall and was the only woman until last year when Rosa Parks’ statue was added."

Wyatt is one of the country's foremost labor union leaders, women's rights advocate and civil rights activist. She started working with the Amalgamated Meat Cutters and Butcher Workmen of North America in 1941 in Chicago and later became president of the local union-the first female to hold such a position. She went on to become the first woman to be elected an International Vice President of Amalgamated. Wyatt's contributions not only helped that union to become more progressive, but also helped open the way for redefining women's roles within the general labor movement. Rev. Wyatt became an ordained minister in 1955. In 1956, she and her husband Rev. Claude S. Wyatt founded the Vernon Park Church of God in Chicago. From 1956 to 1968, she joined Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. in major civil rights marches, including the March on Washington, the march from Selma to Montgomery, Alabama, and the demonstration in Chicago. During this period, Wyatt also became director of the Women's Affairs and Human Rights departments in the Amalgamated Meat Cutters. Her successful leadership of that department led Eleanor Roosevelt to appoint her to serve on the Labor Legislation Committee of the Commission on the Status of Women in the early 1960s. In 1974, Rev. Wyatt was one of the founders of the Coalition of Labor Union Women (CLUW), the country's only national organization for union women. She is also a founding member of the National Organization of Women (NOW).\n\nAs the oldest girl of eight children, Addie took care of her seven siblings while her mother Maggie Cameron worked. Rev. Wyatt credits her mother with instilling in her empathy and a sense of responsibility for others.\n\nIn 1984, Rev. Wyatt retired as Vice President of the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union. Her honors include being named one of Time Magazine's Women of the Year in 1975; and one of Ebony Magazine's 100 most influential black Americans from 1980 to 1984. In 1987, the Coalition of Black Trade Unionists established the Addie L.

Having a Mexican ethnicity herself, she underwent an immense amount of racial discrimination throughout her lifetime.  She took matters into her own hands after she graduated from high school and founded the Mexican Defense Committee.  She passionately continued fighting for equality of Mexican-Americans.  However, Josefina and a few others by her side, were faced with the accusation of being in a communist-affliated group by the American government.  Even though this happened, she still stood up with her pride and filed for a position in Congress.  Nonetheless, she was forced to escaped to Sonora to live the rest of her life because of these accusations.  I believe that her willingness to put her life at risk to continue fighting for the civil rights of Mexican-Americans showed really how much passion and dedication Josefina had toward this social issue.\r\n\r\n	2016-12-04 16:44:19.519445	\N	f	t	1	\N	\N

I will work in my daily life for justice, equality and human rights--the ideals for which the Civil Rights martyrs died.” --Elizabeth Ouyang, ESQ.\r\nAmerica Ferrera (born April 18, 1984) is aa American actress who received critical acclaim for her performance in Real Women Have Curves (2002) and gained more attention for The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants (2005), a movie adaption of a hit teen novel. Ferrera became a star when she took on the title role in the television series Ugly Betty, which aired from 2006 to 2010. In 2007, she received a Golden Globe Award, a Screen Actors Guild Award and an Emmy Award for her performance as Betty Suarez. Demonstrating that Ferrera was more than her Ugly Betty role, People magazine also named her to its 100 Most Beautiful People list. Outside of the awards circuit, Ferrera was selected as one of Time magazine's most influential people and was honored by Congresswoman Hilda L. Solis for providing a role model for young Latinas. Ferrera has used her celebrity status to speak up for causes she believes in, such as immigration reform. She has also served as an ambassador for Save the Children. For the 2012 PBS documentary Half the Sky: Turning Oppression Into Opportunity for Women Worldwide, Ferrera traveled to India to meet the children of prostitutes and bring attention to the devastation caused by sex trafficking. Ferrera, who is of Honduran descent, recently took a stand against Donald Trump, arguing in an online missive that the real estate mogul’s recent comments about Latinos are backfiring. Ferrera noted that by associating Mexican immigrants with crime, rape and drugs, Trump’s tactic had served to "energize Latino voters and increase turnout on Election Day against you and any candidate who runs on a platform of hateful rhetoric.” Ferrara has been very active with the Clinton Foundation and specifically Hillary and Chelsea Clinton’s “No Ceilings” initiative, which aims to expand opportunities for women and girls.

A nativer New Yorker, Rivers carved a place for herself among the Hollywood elite as a comedian and fashion commentator for whom no subject was ever taboo. Despite her scatterbrained image, Rivers graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Barnard in 1954 before breaking into Chicago’s comedy scene in 1961 at Second City with jokes inspired by the profanity-laden routines of Lenny Bruce. She made her first appearance on the Tonight Show in 1965, and Carson became a mentor to her as she began writing and performing for Ed Sullivan, Carol Burnett, and others, as well as acting in various movies.

Throughout her career, Joan was also a vastly accomplished author, penning 12 celebrated books. Her most recent work, Diary of a Mad Diva, was published in 2014 and instantly became a New York Times Bestseller.

A schoolteacher in West Hollywood, Glaser became infected with HIV in 1981 due to a blood transfusion during childbirth and passed the disease to her daughter Ariel through breast milk and to her son Jake in utero. The family discovered what had happened in 1985, after Ariel fell ill. Glaser fought to raise awareness of pediatric AIDS and, once the FDA approved AZT as an effective AIDS medication, pushed hard to extend availability of the drug to children. Unfortunately, her efforts were too late to save Ariel, who died in 1988. That year, Glaser founded the Pediatric AIDS Association, which has raised millions for research, prevention, and treatment. The Pediatric AIDS Foundation had one critical mission: to bring hope to children with HIV and AIDS. Glaser made her first trip to Washington in 1988, when she met with President and Mrs. Reagan, representatives at NIH, and members of Congress. In 1989, the Foundation held its first fundraiser and awarded its first grant for research on the immune dysfunctions in children living with HIV. Glaser’s advocacy led to profiles on 60 Minutes and in People magazine. In 1992, Glaser spoke out at the Democratic National Convention, criticizing the government’s failure to address the AIDS crisis. Her 1991 book, In the Absence of Angels, was praised for its honest discussion of the devastation of losing a child and the difficulties of mourning in the media spotlight. Glaser lost her own battle with AIDS in 1994, and to honor her legacy, the Pediatric AIDS Foundation was renamed the Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation (EGPAF). Under this name, EGPAF has become the leading global nonprofit organization dedicated to preventing pediatric HIV infection and eliminating pediatric AIDS through research, advocacy, and prevention and treatment programs. Glaser’s legacy lives on in her son, Jake, who is now a healthy young adult.

As a Hispanic theologian, she was widely known in North and South America as the chief theorist behind Mujerista theology — she published a book of the same name in 1996 — which extols the role of Hispanic women, especially the poor, in personifying Christian faith in the everyday struggles of life. Her identity as a liberationist theologian was shaped very early on in her Catholic upbringing in Cuba, where her deep concern for the poor and the oppressed was nourished. Isasi-Díaz would have become a Roman Catholic priest, she told friends, if not for the church’s ban on ordaining women. Instead, she became a dissident theologian who spoke for those she considered the neglected spiritual core of the church’s membership: Hispanic women like herself. When learning of her death in 2012, Drew University mourned her passing but celebrated "her amazing and rich legacy of a pioneeering theologian".

Kogan was born in Paris to a poor mother and at the age of 15, she left school to become a seamstress. When France was taken by the Nazis, Kogan escaped with her future husband (who introduced her to climbing), and sought refuge in the Mercantour Massif. Kogan lived in Nice where she ran a swimwear factory with her husband, and among their early customers was Christian Dior. In 1951, Kogan and her husband both joined a Franco-Belgian Expedition to the Cordillera Blanca of Peru and reached the summit of Alpamayo (5,947m) and Qjitaraju (6,100m). Her husband passed away after they returned from the Andes, but her passion for climbing never dare to cease. In 1952, Kogan returned to the Andes and made her first ascent. In 1953, Kogan tackled the Himalayas with Bernard Pierre and made a successful first ascent on the mountain. In 1954, her second Himalayan expedition on Cho Oyu (the world’s 6th highest peak) made her the 1st European woman to reach the highest point of nearly 25,000 ft. In 1955, Kogan made her first ascent of Ganesh Himal (24,300 ft). In 1959, Kogan set out for Cho Oyu with her friend Claudine Van der Stratten, where they were killed in an avalanche near camp along with two Sherpa. It brought a tragic end to the most aspiring mountaineering woman in history. Kogan still remain praise by her bravery and proving that women were every bit tough and ambitious as male mountaineers. The Ladies Alpine Club in London made Kogan an honorary member and lectured on her climbs at their joint gathering.

1262	Laverne	Cox	1984	Today	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laverne_Cox	1206	Cox became known for her recurring role in the Netflix series Orange Is the New Black as Sophia Burset, a trans woman sent to prison for credit-card fraud. \r\nIn addition to her work as an entertainer, she speaks and writes about transgender rights and other current affairs in a variety of media outlets, such as the Huffington Post. Her role in Orange Is the New Black provides her a platform to speak on the rights of trans people. In a recent interview, she stated, "Sophia is written as a multi-dimensional character who the audience can really empathize with—all of the sudden they're empathizing with a real Trans person. And for Trans folks out there, who need to see representations of people who are like them and of their experiences, that's when it becomes really important."\r\n\r\nIn January 2014, Cox joined trans woman Carmen Carrera on Katie Couric's syndicated show, Katie. Couric referred to transgender people as "transgenders", and after being rebuffed by Carerra on the subject of her surgeries, specifically what genital reconstruction she had done, turned the same question to Cox. Cox responded, "I do feel there is a preoccupation with that. The preoccupation with transition and surgery objectifies trans people. And then we don't get to really deal with the real lived experiences. The reality of trans people's lives is that so often we are targets of violence. We experience discrimination disproportionately to the rest of the community. Our unemployment rate is twice the national average; if you are a trans person of color, that rate is four times the national average. The homicide rate is highest among trans women. If we focus on transition, we don't actually get to talk about those things."\r\nLater in 2014, Cox became the first openly transgender person to be nominated for an Emmy in an acting category: Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series for her role as Sophia Burset in Orange Is the New Black.\r\n\r\nLaverne Cox has been noted by her LGBT peers, and many others, for being a trailblazer for the transgender community, and has won numerous awards for her activist approach in spreading awareness. Her impact and prominence in the media has led to a growing conversation about transgender people, specifically transgender women, and how it intersects with one's race and identity. She is the first transgender person to be on the cover of Time magazine, be nominated for a Primetime Emmy, and have a wax work in Madame Tussauds. In May 2016, Cox was awarded an Honorary Doctorate from The New School in New York City for her progressive work in the fight for gender equality.	2017-01-11 16:28:51.249376	\N	f	t	1	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6cytc0p4Jwg/maxresdefault.jpg	\N

32	Fadela	Amara	1964		wisemuslimwomen.org	32	Fadela Amara is a French feminist, women rights activist and politician, who began her political life as an advocate for women in the impoverished banlieues (suburb of large city in France). She was the Secretary of State for Urban Policies in the conservative Union for a Popular Movement (UMP) government of French Prime Minister François Fillon. She is a former president of the organisation Ni Putes Ni Soumises (Neither Whores nor submissive).  One of eleven children born to working class, Algerian immigrant parents, she was raised in one of the many poor suburbs of Paris, known as “ghettos.” Fadela’s activist heart was awakened when, at the age of fourteen, she witnessed the death of her five-year old brother, who was killed by a drunk driver. Incredulous at the insults and mistreatment her parents received at the hands of French police, who subsequently sided with the drunk man, Fadela began taking on myriad causes which highlighted the injustices experienced by the marginalized, immigrant populations of the ghettos. For decades, Fadela’s activist path would continue to address the social decomposition of immigrant neighborhoods, violence against women in immigrant communities, and the ethnic and cultural diversity of contemporary French society. In 2007, Fadela was named Junior Minister of Urban Policy by President Sarkozy, where the core responsibilities of her position concentrated on the rehabilitation of the ghettos. This job would bring Fadela full circle to her roots as a young activist for the rights of immigrants in the suburb “satellite cities” of France and earn her the title “ghetto warrior” by one French newspaper. In a gesture characteristic of her humility and passion for social justice, the new minister continued to live in the suburbs rather than move to the Parisian ministerial residence to which she was entitled as a minister in the French government. 	2016-08-25 17:40:10.649593	\N	f	t	1	https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/435485364/Fadela_Amara_400x400.jpg	https://www.youtube.com/embed/Jkz1LFPgZDY

In 2011, Bahgat became the human resource manager at SODIC (an Egyptian real estate development company). Bahgat’s desire to protest without the fear of sexual assault led her in 2012 to found the “Tahrir Bodyguard”, a nonprofit, non-political organization that seeks to empower women and promote the safety of female protestors and end sexual harassment in Egyptian society. The organization is a result of numerous sexual assaults that occurred during protests in Tahrir Square, Cairo, Egypt. Volunteers for the organization patrol the square during protests in high-visibility helmets and vests to intervene in any attacks on women. They also aid victims and help transport them to safe houses or hospitals if necessary. Tahrir Bodyguard also offers free self-defense courses and pushes for greater police accountability.\nAfter founding the organization, Bahgat focused her advocacy efforts on larger gender equality campaigns. She is a member of the Strategic Advisory Group of The Girl Generation, the Africa-led movement to end female genital mutilation in one generation. In 2014, Soraya became one of the nonprofit organization’s trustees promoting creative learning through special after-school programs for disadvantaged youngsters in Egypt and other countries. \n	2016-08-25 17:40:11.086467	\N	f	t	1	https://oslofreedomforum.com/speakers/soraya-bahgat	https://www.youtube.com/embed/oPOacrKyhg8
64	Asma	Barlas			http://www.asmabarlas.com/index.html	64	I was hired in the Politics department at Ithaca College in 1991 but, for twelve years, served as the director of the Center for the Study of Culture, Race, and Ethnicity (a separate unit). In 2008, I also held the Spinoza Chair in Philosophy at the University of Amsterdam, the Netherlands. However, my career path dates from 1976 when I joined Pakistan's Foreign Service from which I was fired for having criticized the country's military ruler, General Zia ul Haq. I then worked as the assistant editor of an opposition paper before leaving for the U.S. where I received political asylum.\n\nMost of my research is about different forms of violence: colonial, sexual, racial, epistemic. In my Ph.D. dissertation, I traced the genealogy of military rule in Pakistan to British colonialism in South Asia (Democracy, Nationalism and Communalism: The Colonial Legacy in South Asia,1995). After I began teaching at Ithaca, I became interested in Muslim sexual/ textual politics, specifically, in interpretations of Islam's scripture that justify women's oppression ("Believing Women" in Islam: Unreading Patriarchal Interpretations of the Qur'an, 2002). In the wake of 9/11/2001, this interest shifted to looking at epistemic and polemical violence against Islam/ Muslims in the West (Islam, Muslims and the U.S., 2004; Re- understanding Islam, 2008). More recently, I have written about Muslim bodies, differing narratives of Abraham's sacrifice, and Islamic feminism. However, my primary interest remains the Qur'an, on which I have just published two essays in the Oxford Handbook of Theology, Sexuality and Gender and Patriarchal Moments, in Bloomsbury Academic's Series, Textual Moments in the History of Political Thought, (U.K.). Another, "Secular and Feminist Critiques of the Qur'an: Anti-hermeneutics as liberation?" is forthcoming in the Journal of Feminist Studies of Religion. Prior to writing academically, I also published poetry and short-stories.\n\nTo my good fortune, my work on the Qur'an has been translated into a number of languages (Arabic, Bengali, Indonesian, Urdu, Spanish, Portuguese, French, Dutch, and German) and I've also been invited to speak about it in several countries. I have particularly appreciated doing so in Indonesia, Granada (Spain), Russia, Turkey, the Netherlands, Egypt, and Iceland.\n\nI have a B.A. in English Literature and Philosophy and an M.A. in Journalism (with honors), from Pakistan and an M.A. and Ph.D. (with distinction) in International Studies, from the U.S.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   	2016-08-25 17:40:11.238872	\N	f	t	1	http://www.ithaca.edu/depts/gallery_img/60380_max.jpg	https://www.youtube.com/embed/8ac6gA5kbzs

82	Louise	Bethune	1856	1913		82	Louise Bethune was the first woman to work as a professional architect in the United States. Bethune's place of birth probably had something to do with her feminist proclivities. She was born  in central New York State at Waterloo, just the next town away from Seneca Falls, where Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Lucretia Mott had held the first Women's Rights Convention in 1848. Louise grew up within the orbit of the women's rights movement. When she opened her own architectural office in October of 1881, she  timed the move to coincide with the Women's Congress being held here at that time. Bethune refused to enter the women's architectural design competition for the Women's Building at the Chicago World's Fair in 1893. She did not believe in competitions, and the women's prizes were less than the men's. 	2016-08-25 17:40:11.54181	\N	f	t	1	https://scontent-lga3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xaf1/v/t1.0-9/11755107_453921751481799_8191867307226948547_n.jpg?oh=f31130bd0fd57e12bcd24be030436c52&oe=577D886B	https://www.youtube.com/embed/_-JSGBmTQxE

87	Mukhtaran	Bibi	1972			87	Mukhtaran Bibi (Punjabi, Urdu: مختاراں بی بی‎, born c. 1972, now known as Mukhtār Mā'ī, ur) is a Pakistani woman from the village of Meerwala, in the rural tehsil (county) of Jatoi of the Muzaffargarh District of Pakistan. In June 2002, Mukhtār Mā'ī was the survivor of a gang rape as a form of honour revenge, on the orders of a tribal council of the local Mastoi Baloch clan that was richer and more powerful as opposed to her Tatla clan in that region.\n\nAlthough custom would expect her to commit suicide after being raped, Mukhtaran spoke up, and pursued the case, which was picked up by both domestic and international media. On 1 September 2002, an anti-terrorism court sentenced 6 men (including the 4 rapists) to death for rape. In 2005, the Lahore High Court cited "insufficient evidence" and acquitted 5 of the 6 convicted, and commuted the punishment for the sixth man to a life sentence. Mukhtaran and the government appealed this decision, and the Supreme Court suspended the acquittal and held appeal hearings. In 2011, the Supreme Court too acquitted the accused.\n\nThough the safety of Mukhtaran, and her family and friends, has been in jeopardy she remains an outspoken advocate for women's rights. She started the Mukhtar Mai Women's Welfare Organization to help support and educate Pakistani women and girls. In April 2007, Mukhtar Mai won the North-South Prize from the Council of Europe. In 2005, Glamour Magazine named her "Woman of the Year". According to the New York Times, "Her autobiography is the No. 3 best seller in France , and movies are being made about her. She has been praised by dignitaries like Laura Bush and the French foreign minister". However, on 8 April 2007, the New York Times reported that Mukhtar Mai lives in fear for her life from the Pakistan government and local feudal lords. General Pervez Musharraf, the former president of Pakistan, has admitted on his personal blog that he placed restrictions on her movement in 2005, as he was fearful that her work, and the publicity it receives, hurt the international image of Pakistan.	2016-08-25 17:40:11.620064	\N	f	t	1	https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b3/Mukhtaran_Mai2005.jpg	https://www.youtube.com/embed/59ssmLB1_XE

Robinson was gassed, beaten, and left for dead that day on Edmund Pettus Bridge. Born in Savannah, Georgia, to Anna and George Platts, Robinson’s efforts for justice and civil rights began long before 1965. From the 1930s, she and her husband, S.W. Boynton, fought for voting rights and property ownership for African Americans in the poorest rural areas of Alabama, where she worked as a home demonstration agent for the U.S. Department of Agriculture. During the 1960s, Robinson’s home and office became the center of Selma’s civil rights battles, used by Dr. Martin Luther King and his lieutenants, Congressmen and attorneys to plan the demonstrations that would lead to the passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. In 1964, she was the first female African American ever to seek a seat in Congress from Alabama, and was the first woman, white or black, to run on the Democratic ticket in the state. Always a vibrant leader, she was awarded the Martin Luther King, Jr. Freedom Medal on July 21, 1990, honoring her lifelong commitment to human and civil rights.\nRobinson is Vice Chairwoman of the Schiller Institute, founded in 1984 by Lyndon LaRouche and Helga Zepp LaRouche. The nonprofit’s mission is to defend the rights of all humanity to progress -- material, moral and intellectual. Robinson considers the Institute to be “following in the footsteps of Martin Luther King.” The Institute has recently re-issued her autobiography Bridge Across Jordan. In her 90s, Robinson remained dedicated to promoting racial equality. She toured the nation speaking for the Schiller Institute on behalf of the principles of civil rights and human rights, a cause she had championed for more than five decades.                                                                                                                                                	2016-08-25 17:40:12.040272	\N	f	t	1	http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/wual/files/201509/abr.jpg	https://www.youtube.com/embed/Wyy_P4M9Jgc

348	Charlayne	Hunter-Gault	1942			348	Born on February 27, 1942, in Due West, South Carolina, Charlayne Hunter-Gault spent the majority of her childhood in Georgia, where, in 1961, she became the first African-American woman to enroll at the University of Georgia, as well as one of the first two African-American students to integrate the school. After graduating, Hunter-Gault became an esteemed, award-winning journalist and correspondent, working for media outlets such as the New York Times, PBS and NPR. \nCivil rights activists who wanted to integrate all-white Southern colleges approached Hunter—who had been ranked third in her class at her Atlanta high school—to be a test case. The team had thought to start with a state school located in Atlanta, but Hunter wanted to go to the University of Georgia at Athens, which had a good journalism program.\n\nHunter's 1959 request for admission was denied due to the university's claim that it had "limited space." While a legal team, whose members included Vernon Jordan, filed suit, Hunter studied at Wayne State University in Detroit, Michigan. Then a court ruling came: In January 1961, Hunter—along with her high school classmate, Hamilton Holmes—would be allowed to enroll at the University of Georgia. Holmes and Hunter thus became the first two African-American students to integrate the school, with Hunter becoming the first African-American woman to enroll there.\n\nAt the school, Hunter and Hamilton registered for classes amid shouts of protest. A few days later, Hunter's dorm was surrounded by a 1,000-strong crowd that threw firecrackers, bottles and bricks at her window. Though state troopers delayed in responding to a call for help from local police, the crowd was eventually dispersed.\n\nCiting safety concerns, the university suspended Hunter and Holmes from school, which prompted more than 300 faculty members to sign a resolution in support of the two students' return. Another court order was required for the school to readmit the pair. Hunter felt that the entire experience helped mold her future career in journalism, as she learned from the reporters, such as Calvin Trillin, who covered her story.\n\nThough she was isolated from her fellow students for the remainder of her time at college—segregation made going to the movies or eating in a restaurant together impossible—Hunter made some white friends on campus. She married Walter Stovall, a fellow journalism student, before graduating with a journalism degree in 1963.\n\n\n \nBuilding a Career\n\nAfter graduation, Hunter went to work at The New Yorker, where she handled administrative tasks while also writing for the magazine. In 1968, she became reporter for the New York Times, going on to head its Harlem bureau. She also got the paper to stop using the word "Negro" in reference to African Americans.\n\nHunter and Stovall amicably divorced after a few years of marriage. She wed Ronald Gault, an investment banker, in 1971, thus becoming Charlayne Hunter-Gault. Hunter-Gault moved to PBS's MacNeil/Lehrer Report in 1978, and stayed with program when it became the MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour in 1983.\n\nWhile at PBS, Hunter-Gault covered both national and international stories as a correspondent. However, she became frustrated with the network. In addition to her work on MacNeil/Lehrer, Hunter-Gault hosted her own show, a human rights-focused series called Rights & Wrongs, but the program did not receive national distribution on PBS.\n\nHunter-Gault became the African bureau chief for NPR in 1997, relocating to Johannesburg, South Africa. After working as the Johannesburg bureau chief for CNN from 1999 to 2005, she returned to NPR. In addition to her reporting career, Hunter-Gault and her second husband produce wine—for a label called Passages—that is exported from South Africa to the U.S. market.\n\nLegacy\n\nIn 1988, Hunter-Gault became the first African American to give the University of Georgia's commencement address. She has written books about her experience with integration and civil rights: the memoir In My Place (1992) and To the Mountaintop: My Journey Through the Civil Rights Movement (2012). She also authored New News Out of Africa (2006), about developments in a changing Africa. The accolades Hunter-Gault has received during her career include George Foster Peabody Broadcast Awards and national news and documentary Emmy Awards.	2016-08-25 17:40:16.019495	\N	f	t	1	https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c8/Charlayne_Hunter-Gault_2014.jpg/220px-Charlayne_Hunter-Gault_2014.jpg	https://www.youtube.com/embed/6Am_NmZTRFQ
620	Huda	Sha'arawi				620	Huda Sha'arawi was a pioneering Egyptian feminist leader, nationalist, and founder of the Egyptian Feminist Union. Born into a wealthy family in Minya, Egypt. Sha`arawi spent her childhood and early adulthood secluded in an upper-class Egyptian Harem. At the age of thirteen, she was married to her cousin Ali Pasha Sha`arawi. She was taught to read the Qur'an and received tutoring in Arabic, Turkish, and Islamic subjects by female Muslim teachers in Cairo. Sha`arawi wrote poetry in both Arabic and French. At the time, women in Egypt were confined to the house or harem. Sha`arawi resented such restrictions on women's movements, and started organizing lectures for women on topics of interest to them. This brought many women out of their homes and into public places for the first time. Sha`arawi even convinced them to help her establish a women's welfare society to raise money for the poor women of Egypt. In 1910, Sha`arawi opened a school for girls where she focused on teaching academic subjects rather than practical skills such as midwifery.\nIn 1919, Sha`arawi helped organize the largest women's anti-British demonstration in defiance of British orders to disperse, the women remained still for three hours in the hot sun.\nSha`arawi made a decision to stop wearing her veil in public after her husband's death in 1922. Within a decade of Huda’s act of defiance, few women still chose to wear the veil. Her decision to unveil was part of a greater movement of women and was influenced by French born Egyptian feminist, Eugénie Le Brun, but it contrasted with some feminist thinkers like Malak Hifni Nasif. In 1923, Sha`arawi founded and became the first president of the Egyptian Feminist Union, after returning from the International Woman Suffrage Alliance Congress in Rome she removed her face veil in public for the first time, a signal event in the history of Egyptian feminism. Women who came to greet her were shocked at first then broke into applause and some of them removed their veils.\nSha`arawi helped to organize Mubarrat Muhammad Ali, a women's social service organization, in 1909 and the Union of Educated Egyptian Women in 1914, the year in which she traveled to Europe for the first time. She helped lead the first women's street demonstration during the Egyptian Revolution of 1919, and was elected president of the Wafdist Women's Central Committee.\nShe led Egyptian women pickets at the opening of Parliament in January 1924 and submitted a list of nationalist and feminist demands, which were ignored by the Wafdist government, whereupon she resigned from the Wafdist Women's Central Committee. She continued to lead the Egyptian Feminist Union until her death, publishing the feminist magazine l'Egyptienne and representing Egypt at women's congresses in many cities around the world. She advocated peace and disarmament. Even though only some of her demands were met during her lifetime, she laid the groundwork for later gains by Egyptian women and remains the symbolic standard-bearer for their liberation movement.\n\n	2016-08-25 17:40:20.574306	\N	f	t	1	http://kalamu.com/neogriot/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/huda-03.jpg	https://www.youtube.com/embed/Bh0-sc47kxs
174	Annie Lee	Cooper	1910	2010		174	Annie Lee Cooper was an African-American civil rights activist in the 1965 Selma Voting Rights Movement who is best known for punching Selma Sheriff Jim Clark. By the seventh grade, Cooper dropped out of school, and moved to Kentucky to live with an older sister. In 1962, Cooper returned to Selma to care for her elderly mother. Appalled by the fact that although she had been a registered voter in Pennsylvania and Ohio she was unable to register to vote in Alabama, Cooper began to participate in the Civil Rights Movement. Her attempt to register to vote in 1963 resulted in her being fired from her job as a nurse at a rest home. In January 1965, Cooper stood in line for hours outside the Dallas County Courthouse to register to vote until Sheriff Jim Clark ordered her to vacate the premises. Clark prodded Cooper in the neck with a billy club until Cooper turned around and hit the sheriff in the jaw, knocking him down.  She spent the period of her incarceration singing spirituals. Some in the sheriff's department wanted to charge her with attempted murder. Following this incident, Cooper became a registered voter in her home state.	2016-08-25 17:40:13.109893	\N	f	t	1	http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/aaf58e1f4538caa886c98e47a08cedec9a1be516/c=101-0-821-959&r=537&c=0-0-534-712/local/-/media/Montgomery/2015/01/03/B9315700660Z.1_20150103171233_000_GCR9IA0OQ.1-0.jpg	https://www.youtube.com/embed/kqDNx0Yvduk

264	Sonia Pressman	Fuentes	1928		http://now.org/	264	Sonia Pressman Fuentes was born in Berlin, Germany to Polish Jewish parents. She arrived in ‪New York City‬ in 1934 just before her 6th birthday, after escaping the Holocaust. Sonia Pressman Fuentes and her family came through iconic Ellis Island (pictured below) and settled in Monticello, NY. Fuentes went on to graduate from Cornell University as a Phi Beta Kappa and the University of Miami (Florida) School of Law, summa cum laude. Her academic success laid the groundwork for her career as an attorney and her passion for community and feminist activism.\nFuentes’ career includes many firsts for women, while also paving the way for the achievements of others. She was the first woman attorney in the Office of General Council at the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) and helped shape the EEOC’s interpretation of the provisions of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits employment discrimination based on gender. Fuentes has testified before Congress in favor of the Equal Pay bill and is a co-founder of a number of leading women’s organizations, including the National Organization for Women (NOW).\nIn 1999, Fuentes published her memoir, which documents her own history and that of her parents, whose lives she wanted to preserve a record of. Despite the details about her family’s experiences in Nazi Germany, the memoir is (perhaps surprisingly) humorous. Fuentes has said, “Much of what happens in life, one can either cry about or laugh about. Choose to laugh about it.” \n	2016-08-25 17:40:14.752531	\N	f	t	1	https://www.facebook.com/nycrecords/photos/a.147315912073130.30085.127234500747938/665059060298810/?type=3	https://www.youtube.com/embed/6LCNbfAN31s

285	Jessica	Gonzalez-Rojas			http://www.latinainstitute.org/en	285	Jessica Gonzalez-Rojas planned a career making a difference in the lives of women far from her home in Queens. However, after graduating from Boston University with a degree in International Relations, she soon left behind her goal of a diplomatic career with the United Nations when an “internship with New York Congresswoman Nydia M. Velazquez made her realize that there was just as much to be done domestically.”\n\nSince then, Gonzalez-Rojas has built a career around public service, policy advocacy and activism – with a focus on helping her fellow Latinas across the United States. As Executive Director of the National Latina Institute for Reproductive Health – “the only national organization working on behalf of the reproductive health and justice of the 20 million Latinas, their families, and communities” – she works to ensure abortion access, sexual and reproductive health equity, and immigrant women’s health and rights.\n\nGonzalez- Rojas stated, “As someone who is dedicated to the Latino community, I saw the disparities that emerged because of their immigration status, or their socioeconomic status, or the communities that they lived in, so I decided to put my energy into creating a more just society for Latinos.” \n\nWhile Gonzalez-Rojas has dedicated herself to advocating for the rights of members of the Latino community, she frequently works in collaboration with “sister” social justice causes, such as Black Lives Matter, LGBTQ rights, and labor reform – where there are often overlapping constituents and concerns.\n\n\n	2016-08-25 17:40:15.098596	\N	f	t	1	http://www2.pictures.zimbio.com/gi/Cosmopolitan+Fun+Fearless+Latina+Awards+z3fRyojz7dnl.jpg	https://www.youtube.com/embed/W4rrY0gBC1c

393	Noor Inayat 	Khan	1914	1944	wisemuslimwomen.org	393	Noor Inayat Khan is known for the heroic role she played as a clandestine special agent in the French resistance against Nazi Germany.  Noor was born in Moscow on New Years Day in 1914. She is a direct descendent of the Indian warrior Tipu Sultan.  Noor’s father was a Sufi musician from India and her mother was an American from New Mexico. As a Muslim woman, Noor’s cultural diversity and interfaith background placed her in a unique historical, religious, and linguistic position. A trained Red Cross nurse who was fluent in English and French at the advent of WWII, Noor joined the English Women’s Auxiliary Air Force and was trained as a wireless operator. Her French fluency brought her to the attention of the Special Operations Executive who recruited her to be a British special agent. Codenamed “Madeleine”, Noor was covertly flown into France to join the French resistance against Nazi Germany and their Vichy collaborators. In 1943, Noor spent a year in Paris clandestinely transmitting messages to the British before ultimately being caught by the Nazis.  Noor was executed in the Dachau concentration camp by the German Gestapo in 1944. She was 30 years old at the time of her death.\nNoor studied medicine and psychology, was a skilled musician, and authored a number of children’s books, which include a collection of Indian stories published in 1939. Noor Inayat Khan is a hero to the British, the French, the allied forces of WWII, and a model of bravery for all Muslim women. \n	2016-08-25 17:40:16.774796	\N	f	t	1	http://www.noormemorial.org/img/Noorstamp.jpg	https://www.youtube.com/embed/X2nM12xbAUM

Maminydjama Maymuru, 19, will be the first indigenous model to represent the Northern Territory (the least populous of the nation’s eight major states and territories) in the Miss World Australia competition. Modeling under the name ‘Magnolia,’ Maymuru initially declined an offer of catwalk work because she was focused on her high school exams, but after being spotted a year later by the same scout she decided to “try something different,” making her first fashion show appearance last October in the territory’s capital city of Darwin. “Maymaru is smashing stereotyped notions of blonde, blue-eyed beauty,” wrote Aboriginal studies expert Dr. Liz Conor for The Conversation. “Still, the question remains whether Aboriginal women like her can assert a distinct Aboriginal beauty without falling into entrenched notions of the ‘Native Belle,’ with all its trappings of exoticism and objectification.” Maymaru is enjoying her new career, and aims to “break the cycle of how people see life back in the community,” where — she added — she would “trade anything” to go for a weekend of fishing and camping. “I want people to know that it took a lot for me to come out of my shell and do this,” she said.	2016-08-25 17:40:18.008246	\N	f	t	1	http://blackgirllonghair.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Maninydjama-Maymuru-2.jpg	https://www.youtube.com/embed/_zwBvegRcc8
465	Nellie Letitia 	McClung	1873	1951		465	Nellie Letitia McClung, née Helen Letitia Mooney, was a Canadian feminist, politician, author, and social activist. She was a part of the social and moral reform movements prevalent in Western Canada in the early 1900s. In 1911 ,Nellie and her family moved to Winnipeg. The Winnipeg women's rights and reform movement welcomed Nellie as an effective speaker who won audiences with humorous arguments. She played a leading role in the 1914 Liberal campaign against Sir Rodmond Roblin's Conservative government, which had refused women suffrage, but moved to Edmonton before the Liberals won in Manitoba in 1915.  In 1927, McClung and four other women: Henrietta Muir Edwards, Emily Murphy, Louise McKinney and Irene Parlby, who together came to be known as "The Famous Five" (also called "The Valiant Five"), launched the "Persons Case," contending that women could be "qualified persons" eligible to sit in the Senate. The Supreme Court of Canada ruled that current law did not recognize them as such. However, the case was won upon appeal to the Judicial Committee of the British Privy Council—the court of last resort for Canada at that time.	2016-08-25 17:40:18.034456	\N	f	t	1	http://www.portageonline.com/local/44142-nellies-nominees-wanted	https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ip5I3dkvU9U

532	 Alice	Paul	1885	1977		532	Alice Paul, the shy Quaker girl from New Jersey and Lucy Burns, the lively Irish lass from Brooklyn, and formed an unbeatable partnership that changed the dynamics of the Woman Suffrage struggle. Both were scholars studying abroad when they met while working with the Pankhursts in England and Scotland. Returning to America, they brought their own unique version of nonviolently militant tactics back with them and seized the offensive in the American Woman Suffrage campaign. Doris Stevens, in the classic book Jailed For Freedom, called Paul the "cool strategist" and Burns "the passionate rebel." Inez Haynes Irwin, in The Story of Alice Paul and the National Woman's Party, said "Alice Paul had a more acute sense of justice. Lucy Burns, a more bitter sense of injustice. Lucy Burns would become angry because the President or the people did not do this or that. Alice Paul never expected anything of them." \nFirst, in 1912, leading the Congressional Committee of the National American Woman Suffrage Association, then, in 1913, creating the Congressional Union for Woman Suffrage, and, finally in 1916, forming the National Woman's Party, Burns and Paul challenged both the government led by President Woodrow Wilson as well as the more conservative suffragists. Women were asked to put their own issues first. From 1917 - 1919, Burns, Paul, and members of the National Woman's Party picketed the White House and were attacked by mobs, arrested, and put in prison. They initiated hunger strikes and were subjected to beatings and the torture of forced feeding. It is a chapter of American history that few people know, but it is an absolutely vital part of how women won the vote.  The photo below of Lucy Burns in her jail cell was taken in 1917.

When she came back to the States, and despite her peaceful, Quaker teachings, she began implementing more revolutionary tactics in the Women's Suffrage Movement, thus garnering more attention to the cause.\n\nShe inspires me because she realized that the current modes of acquiring women's suffrage, via peaceful means and working with the system, were not enough, and she took matters into her own hands. She galvanized other women, and wasn't afraid to be a leader herself. She revered the past (I think often of the photo of her and her best friend, Lucy Burns, kneeling before the grave of Susan B. Anthony), but understood that living in a patriarchal society dictated that she would need to revolutionize the movement for action to occur. She also drafted the Equal Rights Movement, and remained dedicated to the cause of women's rights throughout her entire life.\n	2016-08-25 17:40:19.098183	\N	f	t	1	See picture file	https://www.youtube.com/embed/5GDe4DkZN2A

Working in radioisotopes, she and her colleague, Dr. Solomon Berson, refined a new approach – called radioimmunoassay (RIA) – using radioisotopes to analyze physiological systems. The technique used radioisotopes to “tag” certain hormones or proteins, making detailed measurements possible of previously undetected concentrations of hormones. RIA opened many doors in the study of disease and chemical responses.\nRosalyn Yalow, wife and mother of two children, believed women could balance career and family life. On receiving her Nobel Prize, Yalow spoke about women in science careers: “We must believe in ourselves or no one else will believe in us…we must feel a personal responsibility to ease the path for those who come after us. The world cannot afford the loss of the talents of half its people if we are to solve the many problems that beset us.”\n	2016-08-25 17:40:23.239459	\N	f	t	1	https://www.womenofthehall.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/rosalyn-s-yalow-150x150.jpg	https://www.youtube.com/embed/8OgrTP7ShQY

Her love for learning, simplicity and the sounds of eloquence is very much intertwined with her interest in the power of stories, spirituality and oral tradition.\n	2016-08-25 17:40:22.236119	\N	f	t	1	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/IgngXsV4rv4/maxresdefault.jpg	https://www.youtube.com/embed/IDCQC3Q82j8

736	Emma	Watson			http://www.unwomen.org/en/partnerships/goodwill-ambassadors/emma-watson	736	Emma is best known for her role as the iconic character of Hermione Granger in the globally successful “Harry Potter” films. Her performance in the first film of the series, “Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone,” won her a Young Artist Award for Best Leading Young Actor. British actor Emma Watson was appointed UN Women Goodwill Ambassador in July 2014. The accomplished actor, humanitarian and recent graduate of Brown University will dedicate her efforts towards the empowerment of young women and will serve as an advocate for UN Women’s HeForShe campaign in promoting gender equality.\nAt just 24 years of age, Emma has already been involved in the promotion of girls’ education for several years and previously visited Bangladesh and Zambia as part of her humanitarian efforts. She has worked to promote fair trade and organic clothing and served as an ambassador for Camfed International, a movement to educate girls in rural Africa.\n“Being asked to serve as UN Women’s Goodwill Ambassador is truly humbling,” said Emma. “The chance to make a real difference is not an opportunity that everyone is given and is one I have no intention of taking lightly. Women’s rights are something so inextricably linked with who I am, so deeply personal and rooted in my life that I can’t imagine an opportunity more exciting. I still have so much to learn, but as I progress I hope to bring more of my individual knowledge, experience and awareness to this role.”\n	2016-08-25 17:40:22.59632	\N	f	t	1	https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7f/Emma_Watson_2013.jpg	https://www.youtube.com/embed/j-xqeTvD3as
