<h1> Community Guidelines </h1>


<b>Our Community Standards aim to find the right balance between giving people a place <br>
    to express themselves and promoting a welcoming and safe environment for everyone. </b>


  <h2>    Key principles: </h2>
 <h3>1) Keeping you safe.</h3>
<b>We have zero tolerance for any behavior that puts people in <br>
    danger, whether someone is advocating real-world violence or bullying
    <br> other people. </b>



<h3> 2) Encouraging respectful behavior. </h3>
    <b>We prohibit sexually explicit, hateful, and violent content. </b>

<h3> 3) Acknowledging cultural diversity. </h3>
 <b> You may not promote violence against or <br>
     directly attack or threaten other people on the basis of race, ethnicity, national <br> origin,
     sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, religious affiliation, age, disability, or disease.
     </b>
